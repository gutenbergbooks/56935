<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I love thee not.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left our party concluding breakfast on the
morning after the masquerade. The ladies
shortly after repaired to the great room, whither
they were soon followed by some of the gentlemen,
among others the Marquis of H. The
scene afforded a striking contrast to that of
the evening before: Sir Archibald’s mysterious
death, together with the atrocious attempt on
the life of Captain Montgomery, seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
have given a shock to the gay spirits of all.
Those who spoke at all, spoke almost in whispers,
their themes murders, mysteries, and
sudden deaths.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham, reclining on a <i lang="fr">chaise longue</i>, was
very nearly asleep, and Lady Morven was already
yawning. Julia happened to enter the green-house,
and was immediately followed thither by
the Marquis. Wise looks were interchanged
by the rest of the company. Half an hour, an
hour, nay, a quarter more elapsed, but neither
Julia nor the Marquis re-appeared. At length
Frances entered the green-house. Lo, the
birds had flown! Julia was found in her own
room writing to her grandmamma.</p>

<p>But the Marquis’s seat at the dinner table
was vacant. The servants could give no
account of his lordship; but, that he had left
the castle on horse-back some hours since.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Julia was observed to colour a little, when the
Marquis’s absence was noticed.</p>

<p>Lord Fitz-Ullin was again at sea; and our
hero had again sailed with him. A new
harvest of glory was being reaped by both.
Almost every column of every newspaper was
filled with the movements of the fleet under
the command of Admiral Lord Fitz-Ullin; and
in every account did the name of Captain
Montgomery stand pre-eminent in the ranks of
glory. No wonder then if that name often
fixed the eye of Julia.</p>

<p>Indeed, the moment she took up a paper, it
was the first word she saw! It seemed written
in talismanic characters! It stood out from
the page, and offered itself to her view, ere, at
least, she was conscious of having sought for it.
Yet there were those (and among them Lord
Arandale,) who suspected that Henry was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
object of her thoughts, when her face and
neck became suffused with blushes on her
being found with a newspaper in her hand.</p>

<p>At length, Lord Fitz-Ullin lost his life in the
achievement of one of the most brilliant of his
victories. The whole nation mourned in the
midst of triumph!</p>

<p>The papers in which, so lately, the heart-stirring
deeds of the living hero followed each
other in rapid succession, were now, with a
mournful sameness, as chilling to the excited
imagination as the still scene they represented,
filled, from end to end, with the solemn lying in
state of the unconscious corse, the funeral lighting
of the chamber of death, the silent mourners,
who watched with the dead night and day, the
sombre splendours of the body’s last receptacle.
The numerous banners waving their shattered
remnants over it; the noiseless steps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
spectators, as they approached, gazed, and
passed, treading a flooring that returned no
echo to their footfalls; the firing of minute
guns by the forts, the lowering of their colours
half mast high, by all the vessels at the Nore,
and in the harbour; the muffled peal of the
bells; in short, every demonstration of what
was the feeling of all, in which a nation could
unite its myriad tongues in one voice of woe.</p>

<p>In addition to the numerous attendance, professional
and official, which was almost a matter
of course, the mortal remains of the hero were
to be followed to the grave by many of the
princes of the blood, and all the principal nobility
of the kingdom. Among the latter, Lord
Arandale intended to take his place; and Mrs.
Montgomery consented, by letter, to her
grand-daughters accompanying their aunt and
uncle to town on the occasion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">… “Britain,</div>
<div class="verse">Well named Great! Mistress of the seas, arb’tress</div>
<div class="verse">Of the earth; dread of the oppressor, refuge</div>
<div class="verse">Of th’ oppressed; bulwark of liberty, hav’n</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> party completed their journey to town
late the day before the internment was to take
place. Arrangements previously made by Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Arandale, had secured for them places in the
cathedral. The pomps attendant on the funerals
of officers of Lord Fitz-Ullin’s rank, being
too well known to require description, we shall
only slightly remark the impressions made on
the mind of our heroine, who, for Edmund’s
sake, was more than commonly interested in
the solemn scene.</p>

<p>The procession having entered, the service
commenced; the effect of the sublime parts of
which, on the feelings of Julia, were such, together
with the all-pervading grandeur of the
music; the slow, but constant movement of the
passing figures; and the still solemnity of all
things else, that, yielding to the one absorbing
sense of admiring awe, she seemed wrapped in
a species of trance, while, from time to time,
a single voice in the choir, separating itself
from among the body of sound, would reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
her ear, pronouncing, with peculiar distinctness,
some impressive sentence.</p>

<p>Pious enthusiasm stole over her heart, as,
with thrilling sweetness, a youthful voice sang,
“And now, Lord, what is my hope? truly my
hope is even in thee!” Again, when the voice
proclaimed, “Man walketh in a vain shadow,
and disquieteth himself in vain!” how contemptible
seemed the struggles of worldly ambition
for the precedence of an hour! And
now the voice pronounced, “In the midst of
life, we are in death!” And poor Julia thought
of Edmund, and of the dangers of the sea;
and her heart died within her. It so happened
that the countenances most immediately in the
view of our heroine, were those of a number of
the oldest naval officers, who were of course,
in general, the oldest men, as the grey hair,
thinly scattered on the brow of many told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>At the moment Julia first remarked this,
voices in the choir were singing the verse,
“Though men be so strong that they come to
fourscore years, yet is their strength but labour
and sorrow, so soon passeth it away, and we
are gone.” No eye wandered, no limb was
restless, while the very stillness of each motionless
figure possessed expression. It was not
repose; it was not listlessness; it was the
fixedness of serious attention.</p>

<p>Many of the countenances bore the traces,
not of age only, but also of hardships. Hardships
endured. Wherefore? To render home
a sanctuary! A sanctuary to infirmity, to infancy,
to those of her own sex, to all, in short,
who were unable to defend themselves! Julia’s
enthusiasm arose: How beautifying, she
thought, is every furrow so produced.</p>

<p>She pictured to herself each individual now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
so quiescent in form; so still in feature; on the
deck of his floating citadel, surmounting a
tempest, or conquering an enemy.</p>

<p>Midnight, winter, every adventitious circumstance,
crowded on her poetic imagining, of
what though she had never seen, yet she had
so often studied in description, that, of all
subjects, it was the one most familiar to her
fancy. Ship after ship arose before her mind’s
eye; till, gradually, they formed themselves
into an invincible bulwark around our happy
isles, establishing them the throne of peace;
while wild warfare desolated the outer world!
“Yes,” thought Julia, “even our foes find
refuge here, when oppression hunts them from
their homes!” And her heart swelled with
pride, that she was the native of such a land!
The gradations of rank faded before this grand
distinction; to be a Briton, seemed exaltation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sufficient! She paused a moment—“How
proud a thing then to be one of those who
have made Britain what she is,” whispered a
small voice within the heart of Julia. At the
moment her eye was fixed in a certain direction,
by the moving a little forward of a figure,
hitherto intercepted by an opposite pillar—it
was Edmund! Her heart ceased beating, fluttered,
ceased again, then beat so rapidly as to
impede her breathing.</p>

<p>Edmund leaned against the pillar, and seemed
listening attentively to the music; he had not
yet perceived Julia. Her eyes dwelt on the
serious and mournful expression of his noble
features, with feelings, where tenderness seemed
to excuse admiration, and admiration to justify
tenderness. His head turned, in a degree
scarcely perceptible. Their eyes met: a sudden
glow covered the face of Edmund, and faded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
instantly; a look passed, understood by both
to be one of recognition, tho’ expressed
only by the standing still of the eye. The
time, the circumstances, were too solemn for
more. A voice in the choir pronouncing,
“Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our
hearts,” seemed to Julia a reproach, for the
mingling of earthly feelings, which had already
found a place in her bosom.</p>

<p>During the performance of the service,
evening approached, and lights became necessary.
The coffin had been placed on a platform
in the centre of the church; the canopy had
been removed, the pall taken off; the solemn
scene, situated thus, immediately beneath the
principal source of light, while all things else
remained in comparative obscurity, had an
effect, imposing in the highest degree. The
numerous assembly of spectators, imperfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
seen,—the occasional gleaming of the arms and
accoutrements of the soldiers,—the shadowy
perspective of the aisles,—all became tributary
circumstances, lending additional impressiveness
to the principal object.</p>

<p>There was at this time a total silence
throughout the church. After some moments,
the voice of the officiating clergyman was
heard, singly, and solemnly, pronouncing
the concluding sentences. And now, the
words, “Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust
to dust,” fell on the senses with that chill, that
shuddering, involuntary sympathy with the
unconscious tenant of the grave, which instinct
grants, while reason would withhold. The
startling sounds from without, of the discharge,
by signal, of artillery, were heard at the moment,
and Julia was aroused from meditation
on the sleep of the grave, by the awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
thought of the last trumpet awaking the dead
to judgment.</p>

<p>When the firing ceased, the leading voice of
the choir again arose, and floating over the
solemn scene like some invisible dweller in its
hallowed light, sang the inspired and inspiring
words, “Blessed are the dead which die in
the Lord! even so, saith the Spirit, for they
rest from their labours.”</p>

<p>The organ pealed, and now a voice more
solemn than the last, sang, or rather seemed to
say, “His body is buried in peace!” An
hundred voices at once broke forth in reply,
triumphantly proclaiming, “But his name liveth
evermore! his name liveth evermore!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My heart is not of yon rock, nor my soul</div>
<div class="verse">Careless as that sea, that lifts its wide waves</div>
<div class="verse">To every wind! If Fingall return not,</div>
<div class="verse">The grave shall hold Comala!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Lord Arandale’s carriage returned that
evening from the cathedral to Hanover-square,
it was overtaken by a chariot and four, driving
at the utmost speed that could be attempted
in the streets of London. Some communication
passed between the servants, and both
equipages drew up. It being lamp light only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and Lady Arandale’s shoulder and hat, while
her Ladyship shook hands with, and spoke
to some invisible inmate of the other carriage,
effectually blocking up the window on that side,
Julia could not see any thing; but she heard
the voice of Arthur, crying, “Good bye! Good
bye!” And that Of Lady Arandale saying, “But
shall we not see you? Shall we not see you?”</p>

<p>The carriage, then, must be our hero’s, and
he must, by a look or shake of the head,
have implied a negative; for Lady Arandale
spoke again, saying, “Oh, I am sorry for that!
Farewell, then! farewell! You’re a good lad:
Heaven bless you! Good bye, Arthur, my
dear,” she added, in a more careless tone.
A hand, meanwhile, was stretched past Lady
Arandale to offer the farewell grasp to those
within the carriage. Julia gave hers when
it came to her turn; and certainly, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the invisible person was aware whose it was or
not, it was held longer, and with a tenderer
pressure than any other. The moment after
it had been released, she at last heard the well-known
voice of Edmund, though scarcely
audible from suppressed emotion: it said
only, “Go on.” And immediately the chariot
drove away.</p>

<p>There was surely nothing affecting or tender
in those two little words; yet, they smote on
the heart of Julia like an electric shock.
They were, at once, the first she had heard
from Edmund’s lips for many weeks, and the
signal for his present departure, it might be
for years, it might be for ever!</p>

<p>The long-cherished feelings of tender affection
for the dear speaker, vibrated to the
tones of that loved voice; and long after they
had passed away, did they seem to linger on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the sense of hearing, like the faint notes of
receding music: How often had those very
tones been heard addressed to herself, and
saying the kindest things! Her eyes overflowed
with irrepressible tears. She could
have envied, at the moment, the very postillions.
Yet it could not have been because
those words had been addressed to them;
perhaps it was, because they were going with
Edmund. He must, she knew, be hastening
to join his ship. He was hastening, then, to
danger, possibly to death—for when we have
just witnessed any impressive instance of
mortality, how fragile, how precarious, seems the
hold on life, of those whose lives are precious
to us!</p>

<p>As Julia leaned back in the farther corner
of the carriage, and, sheltered by the darkness,
indulged in continued weeping, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
thought of the devotion of Marmion’s page
with an admiration and a sympathy she had
never felt before: not that she meditated
following that page’s example.</p>

<p>When Lord Arandale joined the family
party at their very late dinner, he told them
that Captain Montgomery had mentioned to
him his having made an attempt to see them
that morning, knowing that after the funeral
he should not have one moment at his own
disposal; but that, not being aware that they
would go to the cathedral so early, he had
missed them. Captain Montgomery had also
explained to him (his Lordship said) that his
young friend Ormond (now Fitz-Ullin) was
so overwhelmed by grief for the sudden loss
of his father, that he was quite unfit for any
exertion (he was, in fact, so ill as to be
confined to his bed); and that he had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
therefore, particularly requested that Captain
Montgomery would, during the solemnization
of the funeral, represent him, by taking
throughout the various parts of the public
ceremonials, the place which properly belonged
to the son of the late Earl. Captain Montgomery
had not, consequently, been able to
command a moment of his own time, while in
town; and the necessity for joining the fleet
with the utmost speed, was such, that a chariot
and four had been in waiting for him at one
of the doors of the cathedral, during all the
latter part of the service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If this heart must break, why delay the stroke?</div>
<div class="verse">Rend at once the veiling cloud; no phantom</div>
<div class="verse">Of the future, can surpass the wildness</div>
<div class="verse">Of Comala’s fears.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In vain I close mine eyes, through their sealed lids,</div>
<div class="verse">I see his blood!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sisters had returned to Lodore, and
passed some quiet months in its peaceful seclusion,
when one morning Mrs. Montgomery,
handing an open letter to her grand-daughter
across the breakfast-table, said, “It is from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
your father: we may expect to see him every
day.”</p>

<p>Both daughters expressed pleasure and
surprise; but Frances’s hand was the first
extended. Julia had opened a newspaper.
Her eye was glancing over its columns, and
had just encountered the words, “Euphrasia
frigate, Captain Montgomery.” Lord L.’s letter
was read, and discussed; and during the
moments of suspense thus occasioned, Julia
felt her trepidation increase to a degree that
warned her how little she could trust herself
to peruse a paragraph containing such magical
words before witnesses. She, therefore, stole
from the room, carrying the paper with her.
Julia was not at first missed. But when a considerable
time had elapsed without her being
seen, and that Mr. Jackson, who came in
shortly, began to inquire for the newspaper;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Frances, not without feelings of alarm, which
had something very near the truth for their
object, sought her sister. The door was
locked. Frances called softly on Julia’s name.
There was no reply! She called louder still.
All continued silent within! She made hasty
and repeated efforts to gain admittance. At
length, in accents of terror, she alarmed the
house. The door was forced open, and Julia
found insensible on the floor, with the
newspaper lying beside her.</p>

<p>The paragraph she had evidently been
reading, ran as follows:—</p>

<p>“A report has just reached us from the fleet
off *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, that the Hurricane, Lord Fitz-Ullin;
and the Euphrasia, Captain Montgomery;
being detached from the squadron,
fell in with a number of armed vessels of the
enemy. That, the result was, as usual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
brilliant; but, we regret to add, that the glory
obtained on this occasion, has been dearly
purchased; the gallant Captain Montgomery
having lost his life in the engagement. The
private letter, from which our account is taken,
states distinctly, that a cannon ball was seen to
sweep him from the deck of his ship, at the
very moment when the last of the French
vessels lowered her colours. In our next, we
shall be able to give the public, a detailed and
official account of this affair.”</p>

<p>That evening, a few hurried lines arrived
from Henry, written on board the tender of
the Euphrasia, of which he had the command,
and which was conveying the same intelligence
to the fleet. They confirmed the newspaper
report of Edmund’s death by a cannon-ball, at
the moment when the last of the enemy’s ships
struck her colours. He had been standing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
some time, in a very conspicuous situation; and
Henry had seen the ball sweep him from the
spot! Henry wrote in this haste, he said, that
his aunt might not see it first in the papers.
With great affectation of consideration, he
requested Julia, (to whom the letter was addressed,)
to take her own opportunity of
breaking it properly to her grandmother; and
then went on to observe, (by way of consolation,)
that Edmund could not have suffered
much, as he was shattered into a thousand
atoms in less than two seconds!! Indeed,
must have been, from the amazing height, that
he, Henry, had himself seen the ball fling him
into the air. Henry had been, at the time, he
added, alongside in the Tender, waiting, as he
had said, to convey the account of the capture
of the enemy to the fleet. He had been so
near, therefore, that he had seen the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
transaction, as distinctly as if he had been
on board the Euphrasia.</p>

<p>The same post brought a supplement to the
paper of the morning, giving a detailed account
of the engagement, and of the manner of
Captain Montgomery’s death.</p>

<p>Of course, neither letter nor paper were
mentioned to Julia.</p>

<p>While Mr. Jackson is opening the newspaper,
and putting on his spectacles, to read
it aloud to Mrs. Montgomery and Frances,
in an adjoining room, and Mrs. Smyth sits at
Julia’s bedside, we shall lay before our readers
the circumstances, or rather private feelings,
which probably led to the present rash, though
brilliant affair.</p>

<p>At the time of Admiral Lord Fitz-Ullin’s
death, Edmund had found the task of consoling
his young friend Ormond (now Fitz-Ullin)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
difficult indeed. Not only was the grief
of Fitz-Ullin overwhelming, but his self-reproaches
were heart-rending. “He had
never,” he vehemently exclaimed, “been what
his father wished him to be!” He had disappointed
all the hopes of the kindest, the best,
the most indulgent of parents! That parent
had died without the consolation of leaving
behind him a son worthy of perpetuating his
glorious name. How could he be careless of
the wishes of such a parent! Yet he had
always intended to exert himself, and become
all that his father could wish; and now—now
he could never do so. Edmund should have
been his son: Edmund of whom he would
have been so proud! Our hero, after trying
calmer and more religious consolations in vain,
endeavoured to arouse his friend by suggesting,
that the most acceptable offering he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
could make to the memory of his father, was
to strike at once into the brilliant path his
father had quitted. Fitz-Ullin’s spirit, gentle
and indolent as it was in general, in its present
state of excitation, took fire at the thought;
but, alas! he had neither talent nor steadiness
to sustain him in the high resolves which such
feelings suggested. The insufficient impulse
carried him into the midst of daring undertakings,
and there left him, astounded at his
own boldness, and pausing whether he should
proceed or return. Thus, dangers were
incurred, and yet, results not reached.</p>

<p>The business now before the public, and
which took place a few months after Fitz-Ullin’s
going to sea in the same fleet with
Edmund, affords a striking illustration of the
fatal consequences of adventitious excitement,
thus operating on a naturally weak character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The particulars were now read by Mr. Jackson;
the sum of them was as follows:</p>

<p>The Hurricane, a large frigate, commanded
by Lord Fitz-Ullin, being detached from the
fleet off *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, was cruising along the coast.
It was after midnight, and excessively dark,
when the signals of enemies’ ships were seen
in shore; but of what description the vessels
were, or in what numbers, could not be even
guessed. At length, the first breaking of
dawn beginning to render objects a little more
definable, they perceived the enemy consisted of
no less a number than seven large, armed vessels.</p>

<p>“The young Earl, who seems,” said the
papers, “to inherit the high daring of his
noble father,” gave immediate orders to clear
for action. In the mean time, he bore down
upon the enemy, and took up, unfortunately,
a far from favourable position. It was one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
however, in which he could bring a broadside
to bear on some of the French vessels. In
endeavouring to get the Hurricane into a
better chosen situation, Fitz-Ullin, from the
ignorance consequent on his former neglect of
the service, committed so many blunders, that
by the time she was anchored, it was found
that she had actually got her stern to the
enemy in such a position, that for some time
she was exposed to their fire, while but one
of her guns could bear on them.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin suddenly walked up to the officer
of the marines, who was overseeing his men,
as they manned the guns of the quarter-deck:
“Why, you are doing nothing here, Sir,” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Nothing can be done, my Lord,” said the
officer, “while the ship remains in this position.”</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin turned away without reply; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a moment after, ordered the cable to be cut,
and stood out to sea. The enemy, who lay
close under the protection of some of their
own batteries on the shore, continued stationary.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin dispatched a cutter to the squadron,
desiring that the aid of a frigate might
be sent him, to capture some ships of the
enemy: but without mentioning their number,
or the batteries by which they were protected.
To his public demand he added a private
letter, requesting that the vessel sent might
be the Euphrasia, Captain Montgomery. The
Admiral, an old friend of his father’s, issued
orders accordingly.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin, when he saw the frigate coming
towards him, under a press of sail, and
remembered that she was commanded by the
steady friend, to whose talents he so much
looked up, felt his spirit strengthened, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sent an officer on board, requesting, that as
he had first descried the enemy, his ship
might be permitted to move foremost to the
attack. This was granted, of course, and he
led in, in great style, the Euphrasia following.
When, suddenly, and to the utter astonishment
of all, Fitz-Ullin called out, “Man the
cluelines! Shorten sail!” The order being
obeyed, the Euphrasia, of course, passed
them, envied by every officer, aye, and every
sailor too, on board the Hurricane: and no
wonder, for at the moment it was really a magnificent
sight, to behold her advancing boldly
in the very front of peril on seven of the
enemy, supported by batteries on shore, now
opening their fire. But in consequence of
the late shifting of a sand-bank, of which the
pilots were not aware, the Euphrasia, while
still rapidly advancing, unfortunately ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
aground; and thus rooted, as it were, to one
spot, became the very target at which every
gun from ship or battery was instantly levelled.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin, whose wavering mind seized on
the one idea of the danger he saw the leading
vessel in the very act of incurring, called, “Let
go the anchor!”</p>

<p>“Not here, for heaven’s sake!” cried the
first lieutenant, running up to him, and pointing
to the enemy’s ships on one side, and the
Euphrasia on the other; thus indicating that
their own vessel must, in her actual situation,
receive the fire of both, and prevent that of
their consort reaching the enemy. While
this was passing, the sailors at the anchor
involuntarily suspended their hands for a
moment, during which, the vessel, as she was
moving with some velocity through the water,
shot a few lengths further ahead. The command,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“Let go the anchor,” was reiterated
by Fitz-Ullin. The anchor now fell, and
fixed them in a position which, though less
dreadful than that they had just passed, was
still one of more peril, and less efficiency, than
might have been chosen. Such as it was, however,
it was bravely maintained; for not even
the contradictory orders of this, unhappily,
so ill-qualified commander, could, once fighting
commenced, keep British officers and British
sailors from doing their duty.</p>

<p>The Euphrasia, in her terrible, but fortunately,
very effective situation, was behaving
most gallantly. She was the central object,
necessarily alone, and involved in a cloud of
smoke, through which the silent flashes of her
guns were still seen, preceding by an awful
second the loud thunders of destruction, issuing
peal after peal from both her sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin, as the wreaths of smoke from
time to time blew aside on her deck, could
discern the figure of Edmund, now here, now
there, busily engaged, encouraging and directing
his men in all quarters.</p>

<p>Gun after gun, from the batteries was
silenced; ship after ship, of the enemy struck;
and the contest seemed nearly concluded. The
Euphrasia was at length seen to pour a formidable
broadside into the last remaining
vessel which still displayed French colours.
The fire was not answered.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin kept his eyes anxiously fixed on
the moving wreaths of smoke, in which the
frigate’s own guns had now again enveloped
her. When these began to disperse a little,
he beheld, emerging from the white vapour, at
an unusual elevation, the figure of his friend;
at first but faintly seen, afterwards more distinctly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
but still, for some seconds, itself the
only palpable object. Gradually it became
evident, that Edmund stood out on one of
the flukes of the anchor, now partly visible,
and which was made fast to the bows. He
seemed endeavouring to look through the
thickened atmosphere towards the enemy’s
colours, as if to ascertain whether they were
about to be lowered, ere he should again fire.
The enemy were also partly shrouded; but
her rigging and masts appeared, and shortly
her colours were seen descending. At the
same moment, the last gun, which was still
effective, fired from the batteries.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin saw the ball enter the cloud of
smoke, and, a second after, carry with it the
form of Edmund! He could actually descry
his friend’s feet lifted from the spot whereon
they had stood. He clasped his hands over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his eyes, but too late—the fearful sight had
been seen—it continued to float before their
closed vision. He groaned with agony of
mind. When he again looked, the deck of
the Euphrasia, from which the smoke was fast
clearing, had become a scene of evident hustle
and confusion.</p>

<p>He saw, with breathless impatience, every
moving figure collecting to a central point.
He called for his boat four or five times in one
minute. It came—he leaped into it—it remained
without motion, for no order had been
given. He pointed to the frigate, and his men
pulled towards her.</p>

<p>While crossing the open space between the
ships, the Euphrasia’s Tender passed them.
A person on its deck, in a loud and distinct
voice, said, “Captain Montgomery is killed!”</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin shuddered. His nerves recoiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from the sounds. He had himself seen his
friend fall; yet the admission of the fact
through the medium of a new sense, seemed
capable of inflicting a new pang.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Who named the King of Morven?—Alas, he lies</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> grief of all at Lodore was so great, that
Julia’s overwhelming share of it did not cause
any suspicion as to the nature of her sentiments.
The feeling of every one, down to the
lowest servant in the house, was the same, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
if Edmund had really been the son or grandson
of Mrs. Montgomery. Every one’s heart was
full, no one had time to be sagacious.</p>

<p>Frances alone, though without any formal
confidence, had for some time understood the
secret of her sister’s heart. As soon, therefore,
as Mr. Jackson had gone, and Mrs. Montgomery
retired, she dismissed all attendants,
and through a long and dreadful night continued
to whisper to an ear, which yet seemed
not to hear: “The account is not official, Julia,
and Mr. Jackson does not believe it. Julia!
Julia! Mr. Jackson does not believe it.”
This, however, was a sort of pious fraud; for
Frances, who had seen Henry’s letter, and the
supplement to the paper, had herself no such
hope, as her words were meant to inspire.
Julia did not speak in reply; but, from time
to time, by a scarcely perceptible pressure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
her sister’s hand, she showed there was a consciousness
of the kindly efforts to offer comfort.
After the lapse of some hours spent thus, she
betrayed, by a slight movement, that she was
watching for the day-light. As soon as it
dawned, she quietly and silently left her
bed. Frances, without asking any questions,
folded a wrapper carefully round her sister.
Julia seated herself, and became again motionless.
Frances knelt beside her, put her arms
about her, and watched her countenance. For
a long time all was still; nothing was heard
but Julia’s heavy sighs, following each other
at regular intervals, and the gentle, and but
occasional soothings of Frances’ voice.</p>

<p>At length the servants began to move about.
At each slightest noise, Julia started, listened,
and the throbbing of her heart became audible,
increased till it shook her frame, and then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the sounds that had caused it, died away, subsided
gradually, till a footstep, or an opening
door, being again heard; it would again leap
up, and run on with a tumultuous rapidity that
scarcely left her power to breathe. This fearful
state lasted some hours, when, at length,
the postman’s well known knock on a door
already open, was heard. Julia had disappeared
before Frances had time to comprehend
the nature of the sudden movement
with which she had started from her seat.
Frances followed, and found her in the hall,
endeavouring, with fingers as powerless as
those of a new born babe, to open a letter.
Frances assisted to break the seal. It was
from Edmund himself, addressed to Mrs. Montgomery.
He was alive! He was well! When
Julia, by Frances’s good management and a
few hours passed quietly in her own apartment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was enabled to assume something like self command,
the joyful tidings were spread throughout
the house. The letter, and a paper which
came by the same post, were then read with
eager delight by all.</p>

<p>Edmund, in his letter, expressed a hope
of seeing them soon, if it were but for an
hour; and much kind solicitude respecting
their feelings, should the false report of his
death reach them before this precautionary
epistle. The sum of the contents of the
paper, which accompanied this letter, was as
follows:—</p>

<p>The last statement, it may be remembered,
left Fitz-Ullin crossing the space between the
two ships. While getting on board the
Euphrasia he beheld the figure of an officer,
who was busily engaged on the quarter deck,
and whose proportions and air instantly riveted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
his whole attention. The officer turned round;
the countenance was Edmund’s. He was giving
hasty orders for taking advantage of the tide,
which was now beginning to flow. Occasionally
he passed his hand across his forehead, or held
it a moment before his eyes, while his officers
were collected round him, earnestly recommending
a few moments repose.</p>

<p>“I am quite well now,” he replied, “if we
do not get her off this tide she will go to pieces
before the next. When there is time to think
of it, I shall lose a little blood,” he added, in
answer to a strong remonstrance from the
surgeon.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin, at the moment, rushed through
the circle into the arms of his friend.</p>

<p>“The exertions of Captain Montgomery,”
continued the paper, “to get his ship afloat,
were ably seconded by Lord Fitz-Ullin and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
officers and crews of both vessels, and finally
crowned with success.”</p>

<p>After which, the next object became to secure
the numerous captures made in the course of
that brilliant day. This was effected with much
labour, by literally towing them out from under
their own silenced batteries.</p>

<p>And when, at length, the two detached ships
were seen returning from their victorious expedition,
and approaching the fleet with their
little squadron of prizes in tow, the hearty and
general cheering with which they were received
was such as baffles all description; still less
would it be possible to convey any adequate
idea of the enthusiasm with which that cheering
was doubled and redoubled, when Captain
Montgomery, who, from the accounts brought
to the fleet by the cutter, was believed to have
fallen, was discerned standing on his quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
deck, waving his hat, and bowing, in return for
the congratulations of all.</p>

<p>On joining the fleet, our hero learnt, for the
first time, the report which had prevailed of his
death, and that it had been carried to England.
In consequence, he dispatched the letter to
Mrs. Montgomery, which we have seen Julia
and Frances, as soon as they perceived
Edmund’s writing on the cover, so unceremoniously
tearing open.</p>

<p>The paper, as might be expected, expatiated
at great length on the gratified feelings with
which they found themselves enabled to contradict
the report of Captain Montgomery’s
death. The subject, in short, engrossed every
column of every public print of the day.
There was scarcely room for an advertisement!
Wherever you cast your eye, Captain Montgomery,
in large letters, appeared before you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Every figure of newspaper rhetoric was set
forth: the pathetic, the heroic, the sublime,
but above all, the triumphant.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>, supported and advised by Frances, made
great exertions to seem to partake, with a
natural share of interest, in the general joy,
without betraying her own peculiar emotions.</p>

<p>In the evening, for the sake of appearances,
she ventured to leave her room. She had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
taken her place at the tea-table, when a hasty
step was heard without.</p>

<p>The door flew open, and Edmund entered!
Mrs. Montgomery threw over her
footstool and little table, and dropped her
spectacles, in hastening to meet him. She
clasped him to her heart and wept! Frances,
without one thought of reserve, flew into his
arms, and clung round his neck, as she was
wont to do when a child, exclaiming, “Dear,
dear Edmund, you are safe!” And Julia
trembled and turned pale, as, emboldened by
the reception her sister had given him, yet
colouring excessively, he approached and folded
her also for one moment to his breast; for by
an effort she had risen, and stood upright
before her chair, though literally unable to
move from it. She sunk on her seat again, but
kindly smiled as she looked up through tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of joy, and Edmund still retaining her hand,
she returned the pressure of his, more than
once, as a sort of apology, each time, for her
utter failure in an attempt to speak.</p>

<p>“And were you not even wounded, my dear
boy?” said Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>“Nothing more than slight contusions,
ma’am,” he replied; “the ball struck one fluke
of the anchor, and the shock which I experienced,
as I stood on the other, was more
like electricity than any thing else.”</p>

<p>“But tell me how you came to stand on the
anchor?” asked Mrs. Montgomery, “I could
not comprehend one half of what the papers
said about it.”</p>

<p>“I thought the anchor was always in the
bottom of the sea!” said Frances.</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Edmund, to Mrs. Montgomery,
after answering Frances’ interruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with an amused smile, “the enemy had ceased
firing, so that I thought it probable they were
about to strike; and, in that case, you know, it
would not have been desirable to have fired
into them again, as we might have sacrificed
lives unnecessarily, so that I merely ran forward
to the forecastle, and jumped from thence on the
fluke of the anchor, which was made fast to
the bows, and where I stood waiting for the
dispersion of the smoke of our own guns, to
ascertain the point, of whether the last of the
enemy had hauled down her colours or not.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear, you are as bad as the
papers!” said Mrs. Montgomery, “I hardly
know what you are talking about!” Edmund
laughed, and declared he did not know how to
explain himself more clearly. He tried, however,
practical methods; cups, saucers, snuffer-stand,
sugar-tongs, &amp;c., were all put in requisition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
At length, by means of the latter implement,
the ladies were made to comprehend,
that when the ball struck one fluke of the
anchor, the shock was communicated to our
hero as he stood on the other.</p>

<p>Here he made his meaning still more obvious,
by causing the bit of biscuit, which, perched on
one end of the sugar-tongs, had hitherto personated
himself, to spring off with a sudden jerk.
It flew—where?—in Julia’s face! and thence
fell on her bosom, where it concealed itself behind
the neatly plaited cambrick tucker, of a certain
snowy inner garment of fine linen, and became
the companion of a small gold heart containing
otto of rose, and appended to a thread-like gold
chain, which, any one who cared to notice such
trifles might observe, Julia never went without.</p>

<p>This chain, if truth must be told, was,
in fact, one of Edmund’s boyish keepsakes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
when, out of the first prize money he ever
received, he brought one home to each of his
little sisters. It would be a sad betraying
of secrets, however, to mention how often, on
subsequent returns, the course of that small
shining line had been traced by the adventurous
eyes of our hero, till its further wanderings
were lost to view; or, how often, latterly, its
trembling movement, had betrayed to his eye
only, the sigh which was inaudible to all, and
to all but Edmund imperceptible.</p>

<p>But to return, our hero made a thousand
apologies for the first piece of impertinence
committed by his representative. Whether its
further intrusion had been observed by any one
but Julia herself, we are not aware. But what
will sensible people say, when we confess that
our heroine actually preserved this strange
likeness of a lover, and even took a sly opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of slipping it into the interior of the said
golden heart.</p>

<p>“And you may judge,” continued Edmund,
when, after concluding reiterated apologies, he
resumed his account of himself, “you may
judge what force there must have been in the
impetus given by the shock I received, when it
flung me in on the forecastle, to all appearance
lifeless.”</p>

<p>“And how long did you remain insensible?”
asked Mrs. Montgomery, taking his hand
kindly, and looking in his face, with the greatest
anxiety.</p>

<p>“I was myself again in a few minutes,” he
replied, “it was the people on the forecastle,
who, when they saw me actually lifted from
among them, and borne through the air over
their heads, very naturally supposed I had been
shot away, the same mistake it seems was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by the crew of our Tender, which was at the
time under orders to sail for the fleet, with
intelligence of the capture of the enemy’s ships,
as soon as the last should be seen to strike.
But I really had not time to recollect the possibility
of such an occurrence, there was so much
promptitude and exertion necessary from the
moment I was again on my feet, in getting the
ship afloat during the flood tide.”</p>

<p>“You must have had a great superiority of
numbers to contend with;” said Mrs. Montgomery,
“the public prints describe your prizes
as forming quite a little squadron in themselves,
as you led them towards the fleet.”</p>

<p>“How much better those cakes are than our
sea biscuits,” said Edmund, offering the plate
to both the sisters. “It was rather a rash
business!” he added, in a grave tone, turning
again to Mrs. Montgomery. Then, with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
effort at gaiety, he continued, “such as it was,
however, I owe to it my present happiness; for
had not my ship suffered so severely, as to
render refitting indispensable, I should, at this
moment, have been with the fleet off *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.
Fitz-Ullin too was obliged to come into port to
repair.” And Edmund here entered on the
praises of his friend’s good and amiable qualities
with great warmth.</p>

<p>He was soon, however, interrupted, by the
entrance of Mr. Jackson, whom the joyful
tidings of his arrival had summoned. Our hero
had but one day to remain at Lodore.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">“How</span> do you do? how do you do?” said
Henry, as, the next evening but one, he entered
the drawing room, at Lodore, and stretched
two fingers to each of the party. “So you
have had Edmund here, I find,” he continued.</p>

<p>“Only for one day, poor fellow,” replied
Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>“He told me he could stay but one day,”
said Henry. “The Arandales are in town, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he wants to be as much as possible with them,
while the ship is refitting. His hopes in that
quarter are revived, he tells me,” he added,
turning to the sisters, and looking, with malicious
triumph, full in Julia’s face, till her
cheeks tingled again, under his continued
stare.</p>

<p>“You might have looked for a more affectionate
salutation from your aunt, I think,
Henry,” observed Mrs. Montgomery reproachfully,
“after having been in a dangerous engagement.”</p>

<p>“I thought, ma’am,” he replied, accepting
her offered embrace both coldly and awkwardly,
“that no one cared what became of
me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk idly, my dear,” said his aunt.
“But how could you, Henry,” she added, “be
so inconsiderate, as to write the alarming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
letter you did, while there was any uncertainty?”</p>

<p>“There was no uncertainty on my mind at
the time I wrote, ma’am. I was, as I believe I
mentioned, in the Tender alongside, waiting to
carry intelligence to the fleet, as soon as the
last of the enemy should be seen to strike.
Edmund was standing in a very conspicuous
situation, just over me, (out on one of the flukes
of the anchor;) when, bang! and in one moment
I saw the ball coming towards him, and the
next his heels lifted above his head, and his
legs and arms going round in the air, like the
wings of a windmill! I thought, of course, he
must be blown into a thousand atoms! What
else could I think?” he added, observing Julia’s
involuntary shudder, with a look of gratified
malice. “And I supposed,” he continued, still
addressing his aunt, “that you would rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
hear it from a friend, than see the first of it in
the papers. So I wrote on board the Tender,
and, as soon as we joined the fleet, sent my
letter by the first opportunity. I think I was
very considerate! We had our order to sail,
you see, the moment the enemy struck; so
that I had no time to hear that he was not
killed.”</p>

<p>“I am sure, the papers, or any thing,” said
Frances, “would have been better than your
letter, Henry; which was worded, I think,
much in the same delicate manner that you expressed
yourself just now. But you never lose
an opportunity of giving pain, Henry. I dare
say, if the truth was known, you took quite a
pleasure in writing that cruel letter, and fancying
how wretched it would make us all!—For
Edmund is not like you; every body loves
him, poor dear fellow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Candid, at least!” observed Henry, with a
sneer. “But I am always fortunate in possessing
Lady Frances’s good opinion. Sailors,
however, have no time to be nice,” he added.
“When fellows die, or are killed, (which is the
same thing, you know) we throw them overboard,
and if the fighting’s done, pipe to
dinner! Edmund will do as much for me, or
I for him, one of those days; just as it may
happen. Edmund, to be sure, is likely to
kick the bucket as soon as any one, for he’s
cursed rash!”</p>

<p>Frances saw, with kindling resentment, the
pain that every word was inflicting on poor
Julia.</p>

<p>“There is nothing of your strange jargon
comprehensible,” she said, “but such expressions
as are calculated to wound the feelings;
those, as usual, are obvious enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“If young ladies choose to volunteer their
feelings for every fellow in His Majesty’s service,”
retorted Henry, “they’ll have something
to do now-a-days. There’s many a better man
than Edmund, and that would be a greater
loss to his friends too, that will feed the fishes
yet before the war is over, I can tell you!”
“It’s capital fun,” he added, glancing at Julia,
“to see a villain of a shark, after he has followed
the ship the length of a day, just make
two bites of a fellow!”</p>

<p>“Strange notions of fun, you have, Henry,”
said Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>“How should you like it to happen to yourself,
Henry?” asked Frances.</p>

<p>“Not at all, I thank you,” he replied.
“But just fancy Edmund between the rascal’s
teeth, snipping him in two at the small of the
waist!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“You should not speak in that manner,
Henry,” said Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>“Speaking don’t make it more likely to
happen, ma’am,” he replied; “more unlikely
things have happened, tho’! What do you
say to a wager, Frances, eh? What will you
bet, I say, that a hungry shark, don’t make a
dinner of Edmund, the very next time he goes
to sea?”</p>

<p>“Fie! fie! Henry,” interrupted Mrs. Montgomery;
“this is a subject on which we have
all felt seriously, too lately, to be disposed to
jest upon it at present.”</p>

<p>“It’s not quite such a jest neither,” he answered,
sulkily. “If the ball had hit him,
instead of the fluke of the anchor, (as it might
just as easily have done,) I maintain it, there
would not have been two inches square of him
left in any one piece! And what’s to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the next ball, I should be glad to know, from
hitting him, or me, or any other fellow that
goes in the way of it! People must prepare
their fine feelings for such things,” he continued,
looking after Julia as she was leaving
the room. “He has been devilish lucky, I
think, to get on as he has done, and make so
much money too, without getting knocked on
the head long ago! But his turn will come
next, I dare say,” he added in great haste,
lest Julia should reach the door before it was
said.</p>

<p>“It cannot be at all necessary to your professional
character, Henry, to be either unfeeling,
or inelegant,” observed Mrs. Montgomery.
“What can be more the opposite of
both, than Edmund; and you will allow, I believe,
that he is a good sailor.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frances, “he is certainly an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
instance, that to be a brave officer it is not
necessary to be a sea-monster! And I really
do not perceive what right those have to be
the latter, who cannot even offer in their
apology that they are the former.” And she
followed her sister with tears of vexation in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“You should not, my dear,” said Mrs.
Montgomery, as soon as the door closed after
Frances, “address such expressions to your
cousins, as that—‘young ladies need not volunteer
their feelings to every fellow in His
Majesty’s service!’ and such language, at any
rate, can never be applicable in the present
instance. It would indeed be very unnatural,
and unamiable too, of them, if they did not
feel when Edmund was in danger.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind what you’re about,
ma’am, I suspect you’ll have some natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
feelings to manage that you won’t much
like!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Henry?”</p>

<p>“I mean, ma’am, that Frances, who you see
makes no secret of her adoration of Edmund,
will be running off with him one of those
days!”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no!” said Mrs. Montgomery:
“Frances’ undisguised affection is evidently
that of a sister. Besides, I have the most
perfect confidence in Edmund’s honour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, ma’am,” answered Henry,
carelessly. “As for Julia,” he added, “of
course, I don’t like to see her too prodigal of
her feelings to any one.”</p>

<p>“Henry!” said Mrs. Montgomery, “I now
tell you, once more, what I have already often
told you: If you persist in this indelicate
display of your very misplaced, and, you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
be aware, hopeless attachment to your cousin,
I shall consider it my duty (and it must be
a painful one) to forbid you my house, till the
return of her father places her under his
protection.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why my case should be so
hopeless as you say: Julia will soon be her
own mistress; and if she chooses to have me,
I’d be a cursed fool not to secure such a good
hit! Indeed, I tell you fairly, that as soon
as she is of age, if she consents to run away
with me, I shall have no scruples on the
subject. She has enough for us both, and has
every right to please herself!”</p>

<p>“I have questioned Julia, and she assures
me that she neither authorises your addresses,
nor returns your preference.”</p>

<p>“Till she is her own mistress, and can end
disputes at once, she has no fancy, I dare say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for being lectured every day of her life by
her wise friends! However, I say nothing;
time will tell!”</p>

<p>Here the conference ended.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Faults past through love, flavour of its sweetness.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> a week after Edmund’s hasty visit
to Lodore, the postman’s knock was heard,
and no servant appearing with letters, inquiries
were made. A footman replied, that Mr. St.
Aubin had been passing through the hall,
and had taken the letters from the man.
Henry was applied to; but disappointed the
hopes of all by saying, there was but one,
which was for himself. “It’s from Edmund,”
he added carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what does he say?” inquired every
one, at the same moment. “An order to join,
I suppose?” added Frances.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied.</p>

<p>“You are very laconic, Henry!” observed
Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>“Why, really, ma’am—I—don’t know that
it is quite fair to talk of young men’s love
concerns. However, my amiable cousins, I believe,
know all about it; whether they have
thought fit to inform you, ma’am, or not.
Indeed, you saw something of it yourself. It
was a foolish affair from the first: I never
thought it would answer.”</p>

<p>“What was a foolish affair?” asked
Frances.</p>

<p>“Oh all that fudge about your nonsuch
fancying that Lady Susan Morven was to
accept him, forsooth, because some people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
have blown him up with conceit and impertinence,
by choosing to make fools of themselves
about him. But it seems she is married to
the Marquis of H⸺, and Edmund, of course,
is in great despair about it—that’s all!”</p>

<p>“I cannot believe that he ever loved Lady
Susan!” said Frances.</p>

<p>“I have only his own word, and his own
hand-writing for it,” replied Henry.</p>

<p>“Will you shew me the letter?” asked
Frances.</p>

<p>“Why, do you doubt what I assert?” said
Henry, angrily, and at the same time putting
his hand in his pocket, to feign an intention
of shewing a letter he had never received.
There was one in his pocket, however, which
he would have been very sorry to have
shewn.</p>

<p>“I like the evidence of my own senses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
best,” replied Frances, holding out her
hand.</p>

<p>“On second thoughts,” said Henry, “I shall
not shew the letter. Indeed, I don’t think it
would be honourable in me to do so. By
the bye,” he added, “I took a couple of
papers from the man at the same time. I
forgot them, I believe, on the writing-table
in the library. The marriage will be in the
‘Morning-Post,’ of course.”</p>

<p>“My dear, what could you have been doing
to forget the papers? I thought the servants
were airing them,” said Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>Frances flew for them. Julia was, or
seemed to be, very busily engaged about something
at her portfolio; and took wonderfully
little interest in the discussion, considering the
regard (in the way of friendship, we mean)
which she had always professed to entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
for Edmund. Frances returned with the
papers. The marriage of Lady Susan Morven
to the Marquis of H. certainly did appear
printed in legible characters. Frances herself
read it aloud. Various comments were made.
Mrs. Montgomery expressed herself certain
that Lord L. would be much dissatisfied with
Julia for having refused so splendid a match.</p>

<p>“I never said I refused him, ma’am,” faltered
out Julia, in a timid voice.</p>

<p>“He told your uncle you did, my dear,”
said Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you, ma’am, that my fair
cousin here would choose for herself?” observed
Henry with emphasis: and going
towards Julia, he leaned on the back of her
chair with well-feigned tenderness of manner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery looked with a surprised
and inquiring expression at her granddaughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
who coloured to excess; for she thought of
Edmund, and was also painfully aware of the
false light in which Henry wished her to
appear. The blush of consciousness was
deepened by indignation, not the less strong
that it was suppressed. She could not now
say, as she had done when a child, “No,
I hate Henry, and I love Edmund!” He
knew she could not, and she knew that on this
knowledge he presumed. A look, indeed, of
resentment, she attempted. Mrs. Montgomery
saw it, thought it one of intelligence, and felt
alarmed.</p>

<p>Frances, who had turned over the paper
two or three times, now exclaimed, “Oh, here
is something about Edmund’s friend, Lord Fitz-Ullin;
and she began to read aloud as follows:—</p>

<p>“It is with heartfelt grief, we perform the
melancholy task of stating, that the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Earl of Fitz-Ullin, whose late gallant conduct
gave so bright a promise of his following in
the glorious track of his father, has disappointed
every hope, blighted his budding
laurels, and ended his short career, by that
crime of which alone the perpetrator can
never repent: we mean, an act of suicide.
The cause is said to be a love affair, of at
least doubtful character; the rank of the
lady being much beneath that of his Lordship.
The female in question is, in fact, we understand,
the daughter of his Lordship’s nurse;
but very beautiful, and, unfortunately, brought
up at a fashionable boarding school, with
accomplishments and ideas quite out of her
sphere. We understand, further, that his
Lordship became acquainted with his fair
enslaver at first as one of the young ladies
of a certain fashionable establishment, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
being aware of her birth, or even her name,
till after many rural, and, we believe, clandestine
meetings had taken place; and that
the attachment existed even in the life-time
of his Lordship’s father; but was then, of
course, kept a profound secret. The rival,
whose later success with the frail fair one has
caused the dreadful catastrophe above related,
is no other than his Lordship’s particular
friend, the——” Here Frances suddenly stopped
short, and exclaimed, “Nonsense!—Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Go on! go on!” cried Henry, (he had
read it before.)</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” said Frances again pettishly,
as she continued looking over the paragraph
to herself.</p>

<p>Henry snatched the paper, and after a moment’s
search, went back upon and finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the sentence in a loud and exulting tone, thus:
“is no other than his Lordship’s particular
friend, the gallant Captain Montgomery.”—“Well,
faith,” he said, “it was too bad of
Edmund to carry on an amour of this kind
at the very time when, I know, he had hopes
(however ill-founded) of being accepted, by
Lady Susan.”</p>

<p>“It must be all false together,” said Frances.</p>

<p>“You are Edmund’s sponsor, it seems,”
observed Henry. “You would not allow that
he loved Lady Susan, so perhaps it is this
other lady, or rather woman, he loves; and
that he only wished to marry Lady Susan’s
fifty thousand. Or, perhaps, your ladyship
knows best, or possibly has the best right to
know, among so many aspirants for the heart
of this gallant adventurer, which is the
favoured fair one!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“No! no!” said Mrs. Montgomery, replying
to the part of Henry’s speech which
inferred that our hero designed to carry on
an amour of inclination with one woman, and
marry the fortune of another. “That Edmund
may have a virtuous attachment to one
or other lady, is very possible; indeed, I
always thought, and so, I believe, you all did,
that he liked Lady Susan. Or that he may
have rivalled his friend, unintentionally, or
been mistaken in the character of the lady,
is also not impossible: but, that he has behaved
dishonourably or unamiably, I will not,
on any authority, believe! Therefore, my
dear, if you know that he did hope, so
lately, to be accepted by Lady Susan, there
can be no sort of truth in the other
affair: it must be mere newspaper conjecture.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Jackson had hitherto sat apart, affecting
to read to himself the other paper; to evince,
by this seeming inattention to the conversation,
his contempt of the accusations brought
against Edmund. He now arose, and indignantly
strode towards the fire-place. He
stood with his back to it, and, in visible emotion,
pronounced the words, “Contemptible
falsehoods!—No;” he proceeded, after a tolerably
long pause, during which he compressed
his lips, and planted his heels firmly in the
rug, “Licentious excitements (he would not
condescend to a perverted world, by miscalling
such, pleasures) have no temptations for a
mind constituted like Edmund’s! His affections
are of the heart: they borrow not
a deceptive glow, either from the passions,
or from the temper; as do those,” he added,
“of but too many hot-headed, cold-hearted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
selfish rakes, who pass on a thoughtless world
for good-natured fellows.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about any body’s good-nature,”
said Henry; “nor am I editor of the
‘Morning Post,’ to be accountable for whose
amours may figure in its columns for the
amusement of the public. All I assert of my
own knowledge is, that Edmund either was,
or thought fit to say he was, in love with
Lady Susan Morven; that he was coxcomb
enough to fancy he would be accepted; and
is fool enough to be in despair about her
Ladyship’s marrying a man of rank, suitable
to her own.”</p>

<p>“Your statement, young gentleman,” said
Mr. Jackson, “contains, to speak mildly,
many egregious errors! Edmund is neither
fool nor coxcomb! Neither was your observation,
just now, more applicable: A brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
officer, in the regular service of his own king
and country, is no <em>adventurer</em>!”</p>

<p>Julia was endeavouring to leave the room
unobserved. Henry, with an unusually officious
zeal of politeness, flew to assist her in
opening the door. While doing so, he contrived
in spite of all her efforts to the contrary,
to look full in her face, with a hatefully
offensive expression of perfect intelligence.
His unshrinking eye stood still, till it cost
Julia an effort to break the spell, and withdraw
her’s. He knew what she must have
felt during the late discussion; and she felt
that he did so. He had often, in private,
insolently taxed her with her preference of
Edmund; and, so taxed, though of course
she had made no confessions, she had been
too proud to descend to falsehood, and deny
the fact: and thus she felt that the secret of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
her heart’s affections, which timid delicacy
induced her to conceal from those she loved
and respected, was laid bare to the view of
him, with whom, of all the world, she had
least sympathy!</p>

<p>Her sickening sensation, consequently, while
now she endured his gaze, somewhat resembled
what we can imagine might be experienced
by a modest woman beneath the exulting eye
of a libertine, were it possible for that eye,
by its audacious stare, to dissolve the personal
screen of decent clothing.</p>

<p>Julia was again present when the papers
of the next day were read. They said, that
they were very happy to state, that Lord
Fitz-Ullin was only wounded, and that hopes
were entertained of his Lordship’s recovery.
That, strange to relate, his rival was now in
close attendance on the couch of his injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
friend: and that, still more strange, the fickle
fair one herself assisted her new lover in the
task of nursing her old one.</p>

<p>The next paper undertook to gratify the
public with curious particulars respecting a
late interesting occurrence in high life. A
certain young nobleman, it was now confidently
affirmed, had, in the first instance,
actually laid his title and fortune at the feet
of a certain fickle fair one; who had, notwithstanding,
perversely preferred a certain gallant
captain, who, it is thought, though he had
no objection to receive very unequivocal proofs
of the lady’s love, had no idea of marrying
her; and that the <i lang="fr">eclaircissement</i> had taken
place at the altar.</p>

<p>Another paper asserted, that an old woman,
calling herself the mother of the lady, had
rushed into the church, wrested the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
volume from the hands of the clergyman, and
in the most frantic manner, put a stop to the
ceremony. And further, that the said old
woman had proceeded to make such confessions
to the intended bridegroom respecting,
it is supposed, the lady’s late connexion with
the gallant Captain, as had effectually prevented
the marriage. That the Earl had, in
the handsomest manner, sent for his rival,
and resigned the lady to him; after which,
in a paroxysm of despairing love, he had gone
home to his splendid residence in ⸺ Square,
and shot himself.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days more brought a letter from
Edmund, addressed to Mrs. Montgomery;
now it was hoped all would be explained;
Mrs. Montgomery broke the seal, laid the
letter open on her knee, took out her spectacles,
wiped them, and put them on. But
soon tears dimmed the glasses, and the old
lady’s head shook a little, as on occasions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
deep emotion. “What can he mean?” she
said, as she gave the letter to Julia, desiring
her to read it aloud. Julia, on receiving it,
turned extremely pale. As soon as her eyes
ran over the first few lines, she trembled
visibly, and cast a beseeching look at her sister.</p>

<p>Frances took the letter from her, saying,
that she could read Edmund’s hand particularly
well. She began, like the rest, by looking
over the letter to herself. Soon tears
were seen stealing over her cheeks, as she
read on, while from time to time she exclaimed,
“What can he mean? What can have
happened?”</p>

<p>“Read aloud, my dear! Do pray read
aloud!” said Mrs. Montgomery. And Frances,
endeavouring to keep down the choking sensation
that arose in her throat, commenced as
follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must, for a time at least, bid farewell
to all; yes, even to her, who sheltered my
infant head; who protected my infant years;
who was my friend when I was friendless;
who gave me bread when I was destitute.
But I cannot—no—I cannot see Lodore again!
Lodore, that home of happy childhood!</p>

<p>“At such a crisis of my fate, there is much
I ought to say to one so dear—one so generously
interested in the wretched Edmund;
but, at present, I am incapable of a rational
recital.</p>

<p>“At a future time, perhaps—but I wander—you
have doubtless seen all, ere this, in the
public prints. Yet, surely they were not the
proper medium—Pardon me; I know not what
I write—the blow has indeed been severe!</p>

<p>“Perhaps I deserve it all; to have hoped
was madness! treachery! Yet, I did hope!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Yes—or why my present despair? Yet was
it a hope so mingled with fear and with
remorse, that it was torture! Yet it was
hope!—Heavens! must I believe it? Was it
all a dream! a delirium! Was there nothing
real? Or is friendship, then, so like love?
No! within my own breast, how wide the wild
distinction!</p>

<p>“Why then was I deceived? Oh, farewell!
I go, I know not where.—But I leave England—perhaps,
for ever! Yet, think me not
ungrateful! Think not, that the fondest affections
of my blighted heart, withered and
worthless though they be, shall not for ever
cling to the remembrance of the dear, dear
friends, the ever to be beloved, respected,
and revered benefactress of my infant years.
Your unhappy Edmund.”</p>

<p>The letter bore no further signature; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
was habitual with our hero, from a painful
consciousness that his second name was but
borrowed.</p>

<p>The exclamations and interruptions had, of
course, been many. The subject was now
discussed by Mrs. Montgomery and Frances.
Also by Mr. Jackson; for he generally came
in soon after the post hour. Julia did not
venture a word. Lady Susan’s marriage was
agreed upon by all as, of course, the principal
cause of Edmund’s “ridiculously violent
despair,” as Frances pettishly called it.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson, with evident mortification,
was obliged to confess that he had certainly
expected more sense from Edmund. He
hoped, however, he added, that feelings of
such boyish violence would exhaust themselves
in a proportionately short time, and leave his
young friend a more reasonable man for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
rest of his life. There might, however, Mr.
Jackson suggested, be some unpleasant circumstances
respecting this business which
had made so much noise in the papers, in
which Edmund, even without fault of his own,
might find himself involved. His feelings,
his name, might be painfully implicated.
There might be particulars, which delicacy
towards his friend rendered it difficult to
explain to the public. He thought it impossible
that Edmund could talk of leaving
England for ever, merely on account of his
disappointment about Lady Susan; that would
be too irrational: though from his despairing
expressions on the subject of love, it was
evidently the one on which he felt most bitterly
just at present.</p>

<p>The result of the conversation was, a determination
on the part of Mr. Jackson, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
go up to town immediately. His assistance, or
at least his advice, might be useful to his young
friend.</p>

<p>“And give me my desk,” said Mrs. Montgomery,
“I will write to him. He shall come to
me, foolish boy, before he takes any rash step.”</p>

<p>Henry had left Lodore some days since, or
he would doubtless have favoured the family
party with some good natured observations.
He had, however, to confirm opinions of still
more consequence to his plans, in another
quarter—a quarter, which he had lately, by
no very honourable means, discovered to have
become more dangerous than ever. Had he
been present, he could have resolved every
mystery, and shewn all to be simple that
seemed extraordinary: not that he would have
done so.</p>

<p>Julia and Frances had been just going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
take a walk, when the letter was brought in;
they now pursued their original intention, with
an additional motive; the wish to converse
together uninterruptedly. As they went out,
Frances pressed her sister’s hand without
speaking.</p>

<p>They happened to turn their steps towards
the fall of Lodore. The spot is curiously sequestered,
and the space on which the water
precipitates itself, from an immense perpendicular
height, does not appear larger, than the
dimensions of a small room. The steep and
rugged rock rises on three sides till roofed by
the sky; the central side of the hollow square,
is that over which, broken at various elevations
by black projections of flinty stone, the torrent
rushes; from both the other sides, mountain
ash and various sort of trees, rooted in every
crevice, stretch their branches across, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the eye of the spectator, and the white sheet of
descending foam. The fourth side, or ground
facing the fall, is a steep sloping bank, thickly
covered with large trees, beneath the shade of
which, a narrow path leads down to the edge
of the water. Here a seat is placed, on which
two persons may find accommodation; and if
disposed to tell each other very profound
secrets, feel quite secure from the danger of
being overheard; for the fall, which is exactly
opposite, plunges at their very feet, with a din
so tremendous, that the most attentive listener,
standing at but a few yards distance, though
he should see their lips in motion, could distinguish
no sound of their voices, and would
be tempted to fancy, they conversed but in
dumb show.</p>

<p>Julia and Frances descended this path, and
took possession of this seat. Julia instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
turned, and throwing her arms round her
sister’s neck, murmured in a slow whisper,
“Oh! Frances, why did you say it was me
he loved?”</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that, in this situation,
persons quite close to each other, can hear
whispers more distinctly than they could the
voice in its natural key. It would seem that
the open tones were more prone to assimilate
with the loud sounds abroad, and so become
confounded with them.</p>

<p>“I thought so, Julia,” answered Frances, who
also whispered, “and I should think so still,
even by the very wording of that letter; but
that I know, you have not said or done any
thing of late, to change, so suddenly, any hopes
he may ever have ventured to entertain, into
all this mighty despair! Yet, who else has
shown him a friendship that could be mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
for love? as he seems to infer. With whom
else has he had time or opportunity to indulge
in this ‘dream, this delirium of unreal bliss;’
of which he talks so wildly?”</p>

<p>Julia thought of her late parting with
Edmund, and paused a few seconds: then
sighed, and said,</p>

<p>“No! no! there has nothing passed of late
to change whatever may have been the usual
tenor of his feelings towards me. It must be
Lady Susan he means. The expressions you
speak of, Frances, must allude to the time
spent in her society, both here, and at Arandale.
You know, whatever intimacy there
was, commenced the very first evening he danced
with her; and very soon afterwards, you know,
she herself told you, that he wanted her to
marry him; and that she intended to do so, if
Lord and Lady Arandale would give their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
consent. Now, it is evident, that they have
not consented, and that it is Lady Susan’s
having married the Marquis after all, that
Edmund thinks such a dreadful disappointment,
such a blow, as he calls it.”</p>

<p>“It must be so,” said her sister.</p>

<p>“Yet, Frances,” recommenced Julia, “I
had, some how, lost sight of the possibility of
his preferring one, still, as I thought, a comparative
stranger. I had contrived to persuade
myself, that the whole business about Lady
Susan, was either some mistake, as you once
suggested, or a momentary fancy; perhaps, a
feeling of gratitude for her preference; and
I had dwelt with delight on the praises
bestowed on him by all the world, and Mr.
Jackson in particular, who is so sensible. I
had thought, that I too might highly esteem—might—might—regard—with
even—a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
share of—affection, one, whom every one
seemed to admire, and whom, I knew, that you
and grandmamma loved so much. And, oh,
Frances! when, in the midst of the congratulations
of his friends, and the high compliments
paid him by every one, I have seen an expression
of melancholy mix itself with his smile;
and then thought, (I don’t know why, but I did
think so,) that it was in my power to make him
quite happy—with what feelings have I said—he
shall be happy! Frances, in such moments,
I have resolved to—to—be his, (that is, some
time or other. And now—I, who did so
resolve, am as nothing in his eyes! My friendship
for that at least he knew he possessed,)
is cast away, because the love of a stranger is
denied. Nay, my very existence seems to be
forgotten! He is going away, he says, perhaps,
for ever, and he makes not the slightest mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of being sorry to part, either from you,
or me.”</p>

<p>And she stopped, vainly attempting to check
the tremor of her lip, while tears, that it was
useless to try to hide, were rolling silently
down her cheeks. After a long pause, she
added:—</p>

<p>“Were he happy, Frances, I might strive
to forget a folly, which has existed, it would
appear, only in my own thoughts; but while he
is miserable, as he says he is, I know I shall
never be able to feel towards him, as now I
see I ought.”</p>

<p>This was not a spot, where warning footsteps
could be heard; and Lord L. stood before
his daughters, ere they were aware of his approach.
He took his children in his arms.
They had not beheld him since their infancy,
but nature found means to make herself understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
without words, ere Mrs. Montgomery,
who had accompanied him, had time to say,
“Girls, your father.”</p>

<p>In the course of the evening, the newspaper
account of young Fitz-Ullin having shot himself,
became the topic of conversation. Lord
L. treated the subject with gravity, and
some degree of reserve. He said, however,
that he feared there must be some foundation
for a report, which was spoken of
so universally, and with so much confidence.
“Fitz-Ullin’s father,” he added, “they were
all aware, had been his most particular
friend; he very naturally, therefore, felt interested.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Montgomery had left the room
for the night, which she generally did a little
before the rest of the party; Lord L. said
to his daughters, “I do not wish to alarm your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
grandmother, unnecessarily, by mentioning the
circumstance before her, as it may not be true;
but,” and he lowered his voice, “it is now
reported, in town, that it was not Fitz-Ullin,
but our young friend, Montgomery, who shot
himself.”</p>

<p>Frances, fearing for Julia’s presence of mind,
interposed quickly, exclaiming, “Impossible!
The account of Lord Fitz-Ullin having shot
himself, has been in the papers this fortnight,
and grandmamma has this very day had a letter
from Edmund.”</p>

<p>“I am really glad to hear it,” said Lord
L., standing up as he spoke. “Montgomery
bears a very high character; and your
grandmother has, I know, a strong affection for
him; for reasons,” he added, with a suppressed
sigh, “which ought to weigh, at least, as much
with me.” After a short pause, he continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
“It is impossible to place any dependance on
reports. On this very subject there are half
a dozen differing in every essential point. One
is, as you have heard, that Fitz-Ullin had shot
himself; another says, that he was shot by his
friend; and another, that he had shot his
friend; while there is yet a fourth version, as
I have just told you, purporting that Montgomery
had shot himself. They all agree in
one thing only, that a lady has been the cause
of whatever mischief has taken place. I was
but one day in town myself; but being very
anxious about both young men, in consequence
of all those reports, I called at Fitz-Ullin’s
house. On demanding of the servants if Lord
Fitz-Ullin was at home, and, (with an air of
doubt, I believe,) how he was, they answered,
as much to my surprise as relief, that he was
quite well; but added, that his Lordship could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
not see any one at present. I did not, therefore,
send up my name; for, satisfied that he
was well, it was quite time enough for me to
see him on my return to town. I enquired of
the servants, however, if they could give me
any information respecting Captain Montgomery;
(for I had not even his address, you
know.) They looked at each other, rather
strangely, I thought; and an elderly man, after
some little hesitation, came forward and replied,
that he had not yet received orders from his
Lordship, to speak on this subject. This
sounded rather strange; and, at first, made
me stare at the fellow: but it immediately occurred
to me, that the young men had been
engaged in some foolish affair, which it was
the wish of both parties, to hush up as much
as possible. I therefore, as you may suppose,
asked no further questions of servants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the sum of Lord L.’s information;
and after many comments on the incomprehensibility
of the whole affair, the family party separated
for the night.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> breakfast, Lord L. requested that his
daughters would be ready to accompany him
to town, on an early day which he named.</p>

<p>He was evidently ill at ease at Lodore: he
made every effort, however, to conceal such
feelings, and assigned the following commonplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
reason, for the hasty departure he meditated.
He had, he said, already issued cards,
for what he intended should be a very brilliant
affair; given for the purpose of introducing his
daughters at home, to what he considered his
own private circle, previous to their public presentation
at court.</p>

<p>Ere Lord L. and his daughters departed,
Mrs. Montgomery discharged the painful duty
she had imposed upon herself, of informing
Lord L. of every particular of Henry’s very
improper conduct, respecting his attachment to
his cousin. Lord L. was, at first, distressed
and alarmed; but, on questioning his daughter,
was so perfectly satisfied by her assurances
of indifference to Henry himself, and repugnance
to his addresses, that he determined
to treat the young man’s presumption, with
the contempt it merited. Should St. Aubin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
however, in future, persevere in making himself
troublesome; his Lordship would, of course,
forbid him his house.</p>

<p>A passing visit to Beech-park, prolonged by
the delight the girls took in exploring its
groves, so far retarded our travellers, that they
did not arrive in London, till the very day,
on the evening of which the projected ball
was to take place.</p>

<p>The preparations, however, had gone on in
pursuance of former orders, and every thing
was found ready.</p>

<p>Lord L., the moment he had welcomed his
daughters beneath the paternal roof, went out
to call on the son of his old friend, and endeavour
to induce him to join the family party
at dinner, preparatory to the gaieties of the
evening.</p>

<p>No card had been sent; for, on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
all the strange reports that were current,
Lord L. had determined to make the invitation
in person, should he find Fitz-Ullin in a state
to accept it.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">“I have</span> seen Fitz-Ullin,” said Lord L., as
he took his seat at the dinner table, where,
for this day, sat his daughters only, “and I
like him amazingly!” When the servants had
retired, he renewed the subject, by saying,
“Fitz-Ullin is just what I should have expected
from the son of my old friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia listened in breathless expectation,
hoping to hear something of Edmund. Frances
understood her thoughts, and watched for an
opportunity of putting a judicious question.</p>

<p>“On sending up my name,” continued
Lord L., “I was instantly admitted. He received
me with visible emotion, and said, that
had he known of my being in town, he should
have waited on me. I told him, of course,
that I had but that moment arrived from Cumberland.
He is extremely handsome! very
like his mother.”</p>

<p>“Did you ask if he knew any thing about
Edmund?” enquired Frances. Julia pressed
her sister’s hand, under shelter of the table.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Lord L., “indeed, as
soon as I had spoken to him of his father, and
made some few preliminary remarks, I opened
the subject, by inquiring if he could oblige me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
with Captain Montgomery’s address. He
looked somewhat confused, and said, ‘Lord L.,
I am very desirous to have an opportunity of
explaining to you the business to which you
allude.’ ‘I have no right to make allusions,
my Lord,’ I replied; ‘but’—and I hesitated,
‘newspaper reports are not very satisfactory
sources of information; and, it is natural that
I should be anxious respecting my young
friend. Indeed, at present, I do not know
even where to find him.’ ‘You have every
right, Lord L.,’ he said, ‘to make inquiries,
and to have them answered; you are, not only,
the friend of my father, but you and your
family have been, the kind, the generous friends,
of poor Montgomery, when he most wanted
friends; to you every thing shall be explained.
At present I am not quite equal to the task; but
permit me to call on you to-morrow morning.’ I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
begged he would dine with me to-day. He
however declined, pleading an engagement
which rendered that impossible; but saying,
‘that he should be able to get away about
ten, (this evening I mean,) when, if I would
permit him, he would wait on me, and bring
Montgomery with him.’ As he said this he
smiled, though certainly with no very gay
expression; yet, his smiling at all, was quite
sufficient to show that there were no mortal
wounds, in short, nothing very fatal, or irremediable,
in the business.</p>

<p>“It just occurred to me, that I would let them
come, without saying any thing of the ball. The
surprise was a liberty, which I thought I might
take with the son of an old friend. Let me see,”
added Lord L., considering, “it is now some
eight or ten months since his father’s death:
yet I feared, from the evident depression on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
spirits, that he might not be prevailed on to join
us, were he aware of the gay scene which
awaited him, before he was actually at the
door; after which, I should think, he would
scarcely turn away.</p>

<p>“It was very plain, that he wished, as much
as possible, to avoid all mention of Montgomery;
and I did not urge my inquiries, as he means
to bring him with him this evening, declaredly
for the purpose of some explanation. Indeed, it
is clear to me, as I have all along said, that the
young men have had some silly quarrel, in which,
I can now perceive, Fitz-Ullin believes himself
to have been the aggressor. There was a consciousness,
a hesitation in his manner: I fancy
he means to be vastly heroic this evening, confess
himself in fault, and make Montgomery an
apology in my presence. But, as I before remarked,
there can be nothing very terrible in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the affair; for when I asked him how Montgomery
was, he answered, ‘Quite well, thank
you;’ and smiled again, though languidly. ‘He
was not wounded then,’ I ventured to add.
‘Oh, no!’ he replied with quickness. ‘Nor
your Lordship, I hope?’ I continued. ‘Why—no,’—he
said, after a moment of hesitation.
‘And when you know all,’ he added,
‘you will not suspect me of wishing to injure
your friend Montgomery.’</p>

<p>“I saw I was distressing him, so I took my
departure, declaring that I entertained no such
suspicions.</p>

<p>“Well,” added Lord L., after a momentary
pause and a smile, “I trust, from the sadness
of the love-stricken youth, that Montgomery has
been successful with the fair source of their
rivalship; for I have other views for Fitz-Ullin.</p>

<p>“By the bye, I saw three ladies there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as I passed a drawing-room, the door of
which was half open. Two of them seemed
to be in widows’ mourning; and the third,
who appeared much younger, wore something
black too, I think: but she was so beautiful,
that during my momentary glance, I had no
leisure to examine her dress. She was standing
near the door, and seemed earnestly
questioning a person who looked something
like a physician. I heard him say, as he was
making his exit, ‘You may rest quite satisfied;
every dangerous symptom has now disappeared.’
This was as I went in, and before I had seen
Fitz-Ullin; so that I expected, of course, to
find him in an easy chair and wrapping gown,
just recovering from a dangerous wound.”</p>

<p>Then it is Edmund, thought Julia, who is
only recovering; and who, perhaps, may not
recover after all!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“If that charming creature,” continued
Lord L., “was Fitz-Ullin’s fair inamorata,
and that he has been rivalled in her good
graces, I am not much surprised at his despairing
looks: and, certainly, he has not the elastic
step, or triumphant eye, of a successful lover.
We must contrive to console him, poor fellow.</p>

<p>“In the first place, Julia, I intend that he
shall, should he arrive in time, open the ball
with you to-night; after which, should he,
on longer acquaintance, prove what the son
of my immortal friend ought to be, I shall
have no objection to his securing your hand
for a longer period. Do not look so seriously
alarmed, child! I certainly shall not offer it
to him. The hand of Lady Julia L. is a prize
which may, I think, be sought even by the
sole representative of all the honours, hereditary
and acquired, of the great Fitz-Ullin!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Talking of such things, what did you do to
the Marquis of H., to cure him so quickly,
and so effectually?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Julia.</p>

<p>“Yes, you refused him; and that without
consulting me.”</p>

<p>“Had I had the least wish to accept him,
sir, I should have consulted you,” said Julia,
“but—I did not know—that it was of any
consequence—if—”</p>

<p>“Well, take care you don’t refuse Fitz-Ullin
without consulting me,” said her father.
“I have taken quite a fancy to the young
man. There is sweetness of disposition, and
nobleness of nature, in every expression of
his countenance. And, as the son of his
father, I should prefer him to the Marquis,
brilliant as that connexion would certainly
have been. You too, Frances,” he said, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to her, and putting aside some of the
redundant curls that floated on her snowy
forehead, “have, I understand, been casting
loose the chains of your captives also, without
consulting me. We must have a reform in
this department of administration; I consider
myself entitled to some (perhaps my daughters
may think) obsolete privileges in the way
of patronage, which, however, I do not mean
entirely to waive.—There now, fly and dress
yourselves, or you will be late.”</p>

<p>Both the girls having risen from their seats
at the word “fly,” hesitated, and approached
their father, as if they had wished to say,
that they were not quite so undutiful as he
imagined. Lord L. seemed to comprehend
the manner; for he put an arm round each,
and kissed the forehead of each.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time the sisters had completed the
task of adorning, the whole house was one
blaze of light and decoration.</p>

<p>They walked through the yet vacant apartments,
almost lost in the universal brightness.
They were soon joined by Lord L. On
arrivals commencing, he gave to each an arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and stood with them near the entrance of the
first of the suit of rooms destined for the
reception of company.</p>

<p>Crowds poured in. Lord L. felt not a
little of the most amiable, and most pardonable
species of pride, as each fresh party
that approached evinced, either by words or
expression of countenance, as the degrees of
intimacy permitted, their extravagant admiration
of his daughters.</p>

<p>The thunder of knocks, peal on peal, still
echoed and re-echoed. Julia and Frances
were more accustomed to that which reverberated
from Skiddaw to the Screes: for
though they had, as we have seen, entered
some very gay circles in the country, they
had not experienced any thing on this great
scale before: besides, they were conscious,
that they were now the especial objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
notice; and at each loud sound, they shrunk
closer to their father. He felt the involuntary
movement; and, in a whisper, warned them
not to be foolish.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the first and second reception
rooms had filled to overflowing; and many of
the company were finding their own way into
other of the apartments. A number of people
had already, for coolness, entered the ball-room;
and thither we shall, for the present,
accompany them.</p>

<p>After walking up and down for a time, some
began to express impatience for the commencement
of dancing; and others, to conjecture
with whom Lady Julia L. would open the ball.
This led to observations upon, praises by some,
and criticism by others, of their youthful hostesses;
for who, that is worthy of praise, can
escape criticism? so true is it, that a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
woman cannot, with perfect impunity, be remarkable
even for her merits. No one could
deny that they were beautiful; a motion to that
effect was therefore carried, by a clamorous
and unanimous vote, on the part of the gentlemen.
A crowd pressing towards the dancing
room, caused all eyes to turn in the direction
whence it approached.</p>

<p>“Who is that leading Lady Julia L.
towards the head of the room?” exclaimed
one voice. “Who is Lady Julia L. going to
dance with?” cried another. “Who is that
Lady Julia L. is leaning on?” said a third.
“Who is it? Who is it? Who is he? Who
is he?” was repeated by many. “He is very
handsome!” said the ladies. “Do you know
him?” inquired the gentlemen. These questions
were telegraphed from the outskirts of
the standing group into the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
moving crowd, and the answer, by numerous
voices, telegraphed back: “Lord Fitz-Ullin!”
“Lord Fitz-Ullin!” “Lord Fitz-Ullin!”</p>

<p>“Did not the papers say that Fitz-Ullin
had shot himself?” inquired a gentleman.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was contradicted again,” observed
his neighbour.</p>

<p>“They say it was his friend, the Captain
Montgomery, one hears so much of, who shot
himself,” observed a third.</p>

<p>“For love, was it not?” asked a young
lady.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course,” drawled out her
destined partner, dropping a sleepy glance
out of the corner of his eye, without turning
his head; for he was an exquisite; “You
ladies are the cause of every mischief, you
know. You drive us poor men to distraction,
and then blame us for the rash actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
which your own charms have caused us to
commit.”</p>

<p>“It was not the lady’s fault!” said his
partner; “she could not marry them both,
you know.”</p>

<p>“And so she made the best division she
could, you think, in accepting the one as
a lover, and the other as a husband?” retorted
the gentleman.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said the young lady: “but
as the papers said that Captain Montgomery
was the favoured lover, why should he shoot
himself?”</p>

<p>“Cannot say, really. The quadrilles are
forming; we had better take our place.”</p>

<p>“Lady Julia L. is vastly lovely! Is she not?”
he proceeded, after they had secured their
ground. The lady was wondering how Captain
Montgomery, or any body else, could have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
preferred to Lord Fitz-Ullin, he was so handsome;
and only answered, “Yes, very pretty
indeed: and what a beautiful dress she has
on!”</p>

<p>Several sets of quadrilles were now arranged,
and were on the point of commencing.</p>

<p>“What a very handsome young man Lord
Fitz-Ullin is!” said another young lady, to
an ugly, stiff, old partner; who had once, of
course, been young, and, by accident, the
fashion; but who, by thinking himself a prize
too long, had lost both those advantages.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” he replied; “but I was looking
at the lady. Lady Julia L. is really almost
beautiful enough to tempt a man to sacrifice
his liberty!”</p>

<p>“Can that be Lord Fitz-Ullin?” said Lady
D. to a certain gay Colonel, who, emerging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
from the part of the crowd which had lately
entered the room, approached her ladyship.</p>

<p>The Colonel was, or thought himself, handsome;
and we hope, for his own sake, he
was not mistaken; as, excepting his personal
attractions, he had nothing but his half-pay;
not even professional prospects, having taken
the difference from whole to half-pay for the
discharge of debts. His aspirations were now,
therefore, limited to that last resource of
the desperate—matrimony! Lady D. was
a showy, rich, and not very old widow; a
dasher, and a professed admirer of handsome
men: on which last trait in her ladyship’s character
the Colonel founded very brilliant hopes.</p>

<p>“I have seen Lord Ormond in his father’s
life-time,” pursued Lady D.; “but I had no
recollection of his being half so handsome!
Is that really Lord Fitz-Ullin?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“If your ladyship means the gentleman
who is standing at the head of the first quadrille
with Lady Julia L.,” replied the Colonel,
“he is, undoubtedly, Lord Fitz-Ullin.”</p>

<p>“He is a thousand times handsomer,” said
the lady, looking again, “a thousand times
handsomer than I thought Lord Ormond at
the time, though now I do remember thinking
him a pleasing looking young man. What
a difference three or four years have made
(it was six or seven, but the lady did not
choose to say so); he has now so much more
character of countenance, and so fine a
figure!”</p>

<p>The Colonel, not a little mortified, answered,
“The fellow looks as if he were going
to be hanged! and that, with such an angel for
a partner, is quite unpardonable.”</p>

<p>“As the lady’s whole attention seems occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
by the chalking of the floor,” said Lady
D., “it is no wonder she cannot animate her
partner.”</p>

<p>“If I am any judge of physiognomy,” said
the Colonel, “his Lordship’s want of animation
does not proceed from want of admiration:
and, as to the lady, if she does not look up
and smile, she looks down and blushes; and
that is quite as encouraging, you know.”</p>

<p>“She is certainly too demurely-looking,”
persisted Lady D.</p>

<p>“Her adorer probably prefers,” argued the
Colonel, assuming what he intended for a very
graceful attitude, “possessing this monopoly
of his fair enslaver’s attention, to the danger
of her Ladyship’s admiring other Adonises,
as might possibly be the case, were she to
dispense her glances more freely.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied Lady D., with quickness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
“in the case of the partner of Lord Fitz-Ullin,
there can be no danger of that!”</p>

<p>The Colonel fell back, bit his lip, and said
to a gentleman near him, in a loud and conceited
tone, drawing up his eyebrows, and
looking down at his own legs, “Lady D.
thinks, that where Lord Fitz-Ullin appears, no
one else has a chance of being looked at!—eh?”</p>

<p>“It is fortunate,” replied the gentleman
addressed, who was also an acquaintance of
her Ladyship’s, “that all ladies are not of
Lady D.’s opinion. In a late very public
affair his Lordship was, ’tis said, successfully
rivalled by a Captain Montgomery, with whose
name the papers have resounded for some time.”</p>

<p>“By the bye,” asked Lady D., “was it not
said that Captain Montgomery, or Lord Fitz-Ullin,
or somebody, had shot themselves, or
something?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>A gentleman, on whose breast appeared the
stars and garters of renown, now coming up,
said dryly (for he too seemed of Lady D.’s
coterie), “Your Ladyship is speaking of Captain
Montgomery? His wounds, you perceive,
have not been mortal.”</p>

<p>The lady looked her want of comprehension.</p>

<p>“Why,” continued the man of stars, “he
is now standing at the head of the first quadrille
with Lady Julia L. Don’t look for a
moment, or they will see that we are speaking
of them.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” interrupted the
Colonel, “that is Lord Fitz-Ullin!—if you
mean the gentleman who is dancing with
Lady Julia L.”</p>

<p>“Are you personally acquainted with Lord
Fitz-Ullin?” asked the Admiral, for such was
the rank of the starred speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir, but I saw him enter the room,
and heard him announced as Lord Fitz-Ullin.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, give me leave to say, that Captain
Montgomery served with me when he
was a lieutenant; and to repeat that he now
stands at the head of the room with Lady
Julia L.”</p>

<p>“The gentleman at the head of the room,
dancing with Lady Julia L.,” said a consequential
looking elderly man in black, pressing
forward through the crowd, and nodding to
Lady D., “is Lord Fitz-Ullin”——</p>

<p>“Sir?” said the Admiral, with a look of
defiance.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the gentleman in black,
smiling in the angry face of his opponent;
“I had this very day the honour of dining
with his Lordship at his own house, in company
with the Dowager Lady Fitz-Ullin, Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Oswald, an aunt of his Lordship, and the
very beautiful young lady, whose affair has,
unfortunately, been of late the subject of so
much discussion.”</p>

<p>“Where you may have dined, sir, or with
whom, are not points for me to dispute; but,”
persisted our naval hero, “the gentleman
dancing with Lady Julia L. is Captain Montgomery!”</p>

<p>“Is Lord Fitz-Ullin,” repeated the man
in black: “Pray, sir, give me leave, sir,
and”——</p>

<p>“I will give no man leave, sir, to contradict
me! I have distinctly asserted that I am
personally acquainted with Captain Montgomery;
and that the gentleman dancing with
Lady Julia L. is Captain Montgomery: whoever
asserts that he is not Captain Montgomery,
gives me the lie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“My good friend! my good friend! why
so fierce?” exclaimed a new addition to the
circle, offering his hand to the Admiral as
he came up.</p>

<p>Lady D. explained the cause of dispute;
and the Admiral’s friend, laughing heartily,
said, “Five minutes since, I saw Lord L.
present the young man now dancing with Lady
Julia L. to both his daughters, as Lord Fitz-Ullin.”</p>

<div class="verse">“Spirit of Fingall!</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis Fingall himself.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> our readers are desirous to know how this
personage, respecting whose identity there
seem to exist so many contradictory opinions,
obtained entrance to this gay circle, and
the envied hand of Lady Julia L.; nay, how
it was that so many people actually believed
him to be Lord Fitz-Ullin; we must lead them
back, about half an hour, to when, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
where, we left the sisters with Lord L.,
near the door of the first reception-room.</p>

<p>Mammas told Lord L. that he ought to
have allowed their girls a chance, before he
thus cruelly merged all that had been bright
in the hemisphere of fashion in the dazzling
lustre of stars so pre-eminent. The young
ladies themselves thought, that had they had
as beautiful dresses on, they should have
looked just as well. The downright old gentlemen
congratulated his Lordship, with sincere
cordiality, on the charms of his daughters.
Those who still had twinkling eyes, and
merry souls, wished themselves twenty years
younger, and envied the present generation.
The middle-aged dandies addressed well-turned
compliments to the ladies themselves;
and the coxcomical young ones endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to look quite irresistible, as they made their
bows in silence.</p>

<p>At length, “Lord Fitz-Ullin!—Lord Fitz-Ullin!”
was thundered in the hall, echoed, from
servant to servant, on each landing of the
stairs, and finally repeated at the door of the
reception room. The reports of his Lordship’s
intended marriage broken off at the altar, and
of his having shot himself for love, were fresh
in the minds of all; so that the idea of beholding
him, appeared to create a pretty general
sensation; and, at the sound of his announcement,
every head turned round. Yet, when he
did actually enter, Julia was not even aware of
the circumstance. She had looked towards the
door, her heart trembling with the expectation
of seeing Edmund enter with him. And she
had seen Edmund enter; but with whom she
had been too much agitated to notice. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
appearance of our hero had shocked her. It
was that of one who had received a stunning
blow! All expression of feature was deadened,—all
animation of air and carriage gone! He
advanced with eyes scarcely raised. If Julia’s
ideas had been thrown into a state of confusion
on his first entrance, what was her astonishment,
when her father, presenting our hero,
said, “Julia, my dear, this is Lord Fitz-Ullin!
Lord Fitz-Ullin, Lady Julia L., Lady
Frances L.”</p>

<p>It was now Lord L.’s turn to be surprised.
He saw both his daughters extend a hand at
the same moment, while the gentleman he was
in the act of presenting, took a hand of each,
and, though with a pale and quivering lip,
pronounced the names, Julia, Frances, divested
of title.</p>

<p>All this had occupied but a second or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
during which Lord L. had exclaimed, “My
introduction has been superfluous here, I perceive!”</p>

<p>“Why, papa,” cried Frances, “this is Edmund!”</p>

<p>Julia attempted to speak, but failed. Lord
L. looked his amazement, which was too great
for utterance.</p>

<p>“It is very true, my Lord,” said our hero,
raising his eyes, and making a wretched attempt
to smile; “I am both Montgomery and Fitz-Ullin!
and, in that double character,” he
added, in a tone of more feeling, “owe a
double debt of gratitude and affection to Lord
L., and to—to all his family,” he attempted to
say, but voice failed him. Here, notwithstanding
Lord L.’s aversion to a scene, something
very like one, unavoidably took place; at
the commencement of which, however, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Lordship had the presence of mind, to hurry
the party, for a few moments, just within the
doorway of a small refreshment room, which
stood invitingly open at but the distance of a
pace or two, and which was as yet unoccupied.
Here Edmund hastily gave recitals, of some
very unexpected discoveries, which the supposed
Lord Fitz-Ullin’s intended marriage had
brought to light, and which had proved our
hero to be the only legitimate son and rightful
heir of the deceased Earl. The noble conduct
of the individual who was the sole sufferer,
had, he explained, placed him at once in quiet
possession of all his rights. In answer to Lord
L.’s surprise that a clearer statement of facts
had not appeared in the papers, he mentioned,
that the editors had been silenced,
for the present, from delicacy to the feelings
of some of the parties. He seemed shocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
when Frances assured him, that his letter to
her grandmamma, had been completely a riddle.</p>

<p>He thought, he said, that it had explained
all that the papers had left unexplained. But,
he confessed that he had had much to agitate and
confuse his mind just at the time; and that he
did not, therefore, know exactly what he had
written; his object, however, in writing, he
said, had been to mark the respect due to his
revered benefactress, by giving her the earliest
intimation of the wonderful change in his circumstances.</p>

<p>Edmund confessed that he would have turned
back, and postponed this agitating interview
till the next day, had he not got out of the
carriage and ascended the stairs in total abstraction
of mind, and literally without once
looking about him till he had entered the first
reception room, when it was too late to retreat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Explanations ended, Lord L., as the party
returned to the company, said, with assumed
carelessness:—</p>

<p>“It is full time, I should think, for the
dancing to commence. You had better take
Julia out,” he added, lowering his voice, and
addressing our hero, “you know how to prevail
in that quarter, I dare say!”</p>

<p>Edmund, (whom we must in future call
Fitz-Ullin,) instead of colouring became paler
than before, and, without speaking, offered
his arm to Julia. She took it with a sensation
of panic. The strangeness of his
present manner, agreed but too well with
that letter, but for which, and this manner,
how happy had the wonderful discoveries
of this evening made her. How happy, even
for dear Edmund’s sake, had it been possible
not to mingle self with the thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>As she took his offered arm, she was certain
she felt him shudder; but as her own trembled
at the time, she afterwards thought she might
have been mistaken.</p>

<p>They walked up the room in silence. Confused,
and pained, Julia found that she could
not congratulate her companion on his good
fortune with the cordial frankness which had
else been natural, nor ask half the obvious
questions, respecting circumstances so hastily
explained, and which had brought about, thus
suddenly, a state of things, that altogether appeared
to her bewildered apprehension, more
like a dream, than a reality. Oh how delightedly
would she have dwelt, she thought,
a short time since on such a subject, so full of
wonder, and, which ought to be, so full of joy.</p>

<p>But something extraordinary, something
more than sorrow in the manner of this incomprehensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
being, whom she must now too,
call by the new, and not yet endeared name of
Fitz-Ullin, seemed to have raised up an insuperable
barrier between them. Even the expression
of his countenance, (though still she
beheld the features of Edmund) was, in all that
regarded mind, or indicated feeling, utterly
changed.</p>

<p>His presence inspired her with an almost
superstitious awe! He was so like, and yet so
unlike himself, that she traced the resemblance,
with feelings not far removed from those with
which the identity of a visitant from the grave
might be recognised. And strange it is, that
such identity should appal, while it portrays
what, in life, would have claimed our fondest
embrace.</p>

<p>He was indeed evidently miserable; and that
idea, awakened every habitual feeling of tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in Julia’s breast. The thought of,
why he was thus unhappy, came next in
the train of reflections, and, as it presented
itself in the unwelcome form of his love for
another, she unconsciously suffered a sigh to be
audible.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin looked suddenly round; her eyes
were bent downwards; and now, for the first
time since he entered the room, he permitted
his to dwell, for a few seconds, on that perfect
loveliness which he had never contemplated,
even in imagination, without a bewildering sense
of delight, which rendered the lapse of time
imperceptible. Julia felt his silent gaze,
though she saw it not, and a thrill of pleasure
accompanied the consciousness; for which
weakness, however, she instantly condemned
herself.</p>

<p>Thus occupied, our hero and heroine, arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
at the head of the dancing room, forgetful of
all present, while the eyes, if not of all, of
many, were, as we have seen, fixed on them.
But where is that radiant joy; where that sunshine
of the heart brightening every feature,
which might naturally be expected, at this
moment, to appear on the countenance of the
once humble Edmund, feeling himself, as he
must now do, in every circumstance the equal
of that Julia, whom he had so long thought it
presumption, nay even ingratitude to love;
yet loved to an excess so uncontroulable, that
no power was left of concealing his passion,
and to fly its object, had become his only
resource.</p>

<p>When last he had been her partner in a scene
like the present, could some prophetic voice
have said, “Within a few short months shall
Edmund, whose only home is the deep, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
wide domains and large possessions, inherited
from his forefathers: Edmund, whose very
name is but a borrowed right, have titles and
dignities, descending through lines of honoured
ancestry, and centring in him: Edmund, who
knows not at what unlettered grave to mourn
a father’s loss, be found the son of him whose
memory has been embalmed by a nation’s tears!”</p>

<p>With what feelings had he hailed the wondrous
prophecy! Yet, at this moment, was all
the fairy-tale vision realized, and Edmund, notwithstanding,
entered the mazes of the joyous
dance, looking and moving like one, bewildered
by the excess of mental suffering.</p>

<p>The laws of the figure constantly severed the
hand of his partner from his, and as constantly
required him to retake it; but, what with anticipating
this part of the ceremony at one time,
and delaying it at another, he was more than
once guilty of actually deranging the order of
the quadrille.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> Lady D.’s party, whom we left in
high contest as to the identity of Lady Julia
L.’s partner, seem to have settled that point in
an amicable manner, and to be now busily
occupied, listening to an oration from the old
gentleman in black.</p>

<p>It is evident that he has been entertaining his
audience with some of the particulars of our
hero’s adventures when a child.</p>

<p>From the account which this seemingly well-informed
speaker proceeds to give, it would
appear that the information contained in the
ill-spelt, undated letter of Edmund’s nurse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
was, as far as it was intelligible, true: so
much so, indeed, that we recommend a second
perusal of the precious document to all who
may have forgotten any part of its contents.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin was, it seems, the title of the
great family alluded to anonymously by the
nurse. Edmund had, as the letter stated,
been stolen when an infant in arms off the
lawn by a strolling beggar, at a time when
the family were from home. His nurse had
substituted her own child, at first, to avoid
blame. Afterwards, she had grown too fond
of seeing her son bringing up to be a young
lord, to seize, or inform against, the bold
vagrant when she discovered her, as mentioned
in the letter, carrying the stolen child
about.</p>

<p>The smiling boy, described in the letter as
flinging his cake out of the carriage window
to poor Edmund, when on crutches, and apparently
with but one leg, he begged before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
it, was no other than our hero’s after friend,
Ormond, now proved to be the nurse’s child.
And the lady, who had sat with the smiling
boy on her knee, thinking him her own son,
and looked out, with but a passing feeling
of compassion on the one little bare foot of
the mendicant child, half sunk in the wet mud
of the street, its little shoulders almost forced
out of their sockets by its crutches, and its
poor little features wearing the wan expression
of premature misery, was no other than that
mendicant child’s own mother, the first Lady
Fitz-Ullin. This was some years after he
had been stolen. Soon after this it was that
poor little Edmund had been carried over
to Cumberland by the said vagrant, in company
with a ship-load of reapers. After the
harvest he had been led about at Keswick
Regatta, to excite the compassion of the
company; and after the Regatta, abandoned,
as we have described, by his then supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
mother, the beggar woman; who, when
caught in the fact of stealing linen from a
hedge, was obliged to have recourse to hasty
flight.</p>

<p>The narrator next proceeded to recount,
what we already know, the particulars of how
poor Edmund, on the evening of the day
he had been thus abandoned, and nearly
perishing with cold and hunger, was found
on the borders of the lake, by Mrs. Montgomery’s
daughter, Lady L.; brought home
by her; and, ever since, cherished and protected
by the whole family.</p>

<p>“And was the gentleman who is now
dancing with Lady Julia L.,” inquired a young
lady, “that poor little boy that was begging
under the carriage window; and who is now
Lord Fitz-Ullin? How curious!”</p>

<p>“Precisely so, madam,” replied our sable
orator.</p>

<p>When it was mentioned that the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Lord Fitz-Ullin, during all the years from
childhood upwards, had, as Edmund Montgomery,
been the constant, intimate companion
of Lord L.’s daughters, the Colonel, addressing
Lady D. aside, laid claim to some discernment.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” continued the young
lady, “if I were Lord Fitz-Ullin, I should
be always quite afraid I might turn out
to be somebody else, some other time.”</p>

<p>“The proofs of his Lordship’s identity,
madam,” said the important man in black,
“had been carefully preserved by wretches,
who hoped to have made a market of the
secret; and who indeed would, as it has lately
appeared, have done so, had it not been for
the upright and honourable feelings of the
poor young man himself.”</p>

<p>“But, sir,” enquired Lady D., “does Lord
Fitz-Ullin intend to marry the lady, who
figured in the papers lately as the cause of all
the fracas?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly not, madam!” replied the proud
explainer of mysteries, who now saw himself
surrounded by a numerous audience. “In the
first place, madam, you must recollect, that it
was not Lord Fitz-Ullin, but the unfortunate
young man who was then supposed to be Lord
Fitz-Ullin, who was about to marry the young
lady. And in the second place, madam, the
young lady is a sort of half sister of his Lordship’s.”</p>

<p>“Sister!” exclaimed Lady D., “surely the
late Lord Fitz-Ullin left no daughter by either
marriage.”</p>

<p>“I do not mean to say,” continued the
speaker, “that the young lady, or young
woman, is daughter to either of the Ladies
Fitz-Ullin; she is, notwithstanding, daughter
to the late Lord Fitz-Ullin, and twin sister
to the unhappy young man who, for so many
years, was called Lord Ormond; and who,
for the last few months, has borne the title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of Fitz-Ullin; and who is now simply Mr., or
rather Captain Ormond; and that only by
courtesy: such children having in law, I
believe, no right to any name but their mother’s.”</p>

<p>“A terrible thing for him, poor young
man!” said Lady D. “He can never bear
to meet any of his former acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“The present Lord Fitz-Ullin, however,”
continued our enlightened informer, “has
behaved towards him with the noblest liberality,
as well as towards Miss Ormond, as
the sister is now called.”</p>

<p>“And pray, Doctor ⸺, what had she
been called? There was no name mentioned
in the papers, I think.”</p>

<p>“O’Neil, the name of her mother’s husband,
who was the land steward.”</p>

<p>“And pray who was her mother?”</p>

<p>“The woman was the present Lord Fitz-Ullin’s
nurse, madam: and one of her apologies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
for having substituted her own child in
place of the rightful heir, when the Lady’s
child (as she still calls his present Lordship)
had been stolen from her was, that her own
boy was a son of Lord Fitz-Ullin.”</p>

<p>“And what led to the discovery of all this
just now? and can you tell, as you seem so
well-informed, what all that was which appeared
in the papers about a rivalship, and
a marriage broken off at the altar, and a shooting-match,
&amp;c.”</p>

<p>“I can, madam:” and here the gentleman
in black bowed, smiled, and took a pinch of
snuff. “Indeed, I may say,” he added, while
closing his box, “that I am (being a friend
of the family) in some measure authorized to
correct misapprehensions on this subject. We
have, I believe, succeeded at last in silencing the
papers; that is, since the first day or two; as
soon, in fact, as Lord Fitz-Ullin had leisure
to attend to any thing. It was his wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
do so, from delicacy to the feelings of Captain
Ormond.” For the same reasons, as well as
for many others, we suspect that his Lordship
would have also gladly silenced the present
speaker, had that been equally possible; for,
if we are not much mistaken, he is far exceeding
his commission for the correction of misapprehensions.</p>

<p>This self-elected friend of the family is,
however, very good authority; being no other
than the physician who had been, and still
was, in attendance on Ormond. He is one
of His Majesty’s physicians, and a man of so
much eminence, notwithstanding his communicative
propensities, that he is in the best
society.</p>

<p>“In the first place, madam,” continued the
Doctor, in answer to Lady D.’s list of questions,
“though there certainly was a marriage
broken off at the altar, there was no rivalship
whatever, nor the slightest foundation for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a rumour. The catastrophe, indeed, was much
hastened, and almost all the wild reports
which have gone abroad, produced by Captain
Ormond’s unfortunate passion for the young
lady who afterwards proved to be his sister;
and with whom he had at first become acquainted
during her residence at some finishing boarding-school.
So violent, indeed, was the attachment
which subsisted between these young
persons; strengthened, as it was, by long
indulgence; for they had been secretly engaged
for years, it seems; that nothing could prevent
the marriage, but confession on the part of
the mother. This she delayed till the last
moment; in fact, till her son and daughter
stood together at the altar! Then it was
that rushing past them with screams like
those of a maniac, and with such velocity
that indeed, though every one looked round
to discover whence the sounds came, (for
I happened to be present, madam,) no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
saw her till she stood beside the officiating
clergyman; when, laying one hand on his lips
and spreading the other over his open book,
after remaining speechless from want of breath
for a few moments, during which the wonder
of the beholders was very great, she shrieked
aloud, in accents that rang through the whole
church, that they were brother and sister!
nay, that they were twins! that she herself
was their mother; their wretched, sinful mother;
and that the late Lord Fitz-Ullin was
their father.</p>

<p>“The poor young man was so much affected
by the scene which followed; the frantic
appearance of the old woman who called
herself his mother; the fainting away of the
interesting, and certainly very beautiful young
creature, whose hand he still held, and whom
he scarcely knew whether to call sister or
bride; the great change in his own circumstances
too, and the sudden revulsion of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
feelings; that, in short, he went home, (or
rather to the house which he had so long
thought his home,) and shot himself!—that is,
attempted to do so; indeed, did wound himself:
it was his friend, the rightful and present
Lord Fitz-Ullin, who was fortunate enough to
prevent his completing his terrible purpose.”</p>

<p>Various expressions of pity and horror were
here uttered by the listeners. “Indeed, the
young man,” continued the speaker, “deserves
well of the Earl, for his conduct on the occasion
was truly noble.”</p>

<p>“On entering his hall, on his return from
church, he was beset by the wretches, in whose
hands were every proof by which his present
Lordship could substantiate his claims. These
they offered, for a certain sum, so effectually
to suppress, that notwithstanding the wild
declaration of the woman in church, the rightful
Earl should never be able legally to dispossess
him, either of title or property. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
however, spurned all such offers with the
utmost indignation; and would not suffer the
persons to leave his presence, till he had sent
for his Lordship—I mean his present Lordship—then
commonly called Captain Montgomery,
and laid all the facts before him. After which
it was, that the poor young man retired to his
sleeping apartment, and made that rash attempt
upon his own life, which I before mentioned.
I had always attended the late Earl, whose
friendship I had the honour of possessing.
I was therefore sent for by Lady Fitz-Ullin
immediately, and have, of course, visited the
house, either in my medical or friendly capacity,
every day since; and I have the satisfaction
to say, that I can now pronounce
Captain Ormond out of danger.</p>

<p>“I never heard any thing so shocking!” said
the Admiral, in a tone of much feeling, for since
the first ebullition of his wrath on being contradicted,
he had become an interested listener;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
“that poor young man, brought up to fortune,
rank, title, every thing, now thrown
on the world, without a home, or even a name!”</p>

<p>“When I last saw him,” said Lady D., “it
was at his father’s table. A mild looking young
man with a sweet smile. I remember he sat
opposite to me, talking to a daughter of the
Duke of B. I said, you know,” she added
turning to the Colonel, “that this man’s countenance
was not quite what I thought I could
recollect of Lord Ormond.”</p>

<p>“The young man has been a most unhappy,
and, it would appear innocent victim of the
moral turpitude of others;” observed a gentleman
who had not before spoken, and whose
black silk apron proclaimed him a dignitary of
the church. “The story affords a striking,
practical revelation of the will of Him, who has
ordained that misery shall be the fruit of vice;”
he added, addressing a younger person on
whose arm he leaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The general move occasioned by the breaking
up of the now concluded set of quadrilles,
dispersed our listening party, and sent them to
seek various amusements in other parts of the
gay assembly.</p>

<p>Immediately after Julia had gone into the
dancing-room with Edmund, a handsome lively
young man, not much above the middle size,
but remarkably well made, came up to Lord L.,
with whom he appeared well acquainted. He
particularly requested an introduction to Frances,
which Lord L., without absolute reluctance,
granted; for young Beaumont, though but
second son to Lord Beaumont, might be classed
among those whom Lord L. considered as
proper young men, being grandson to the Duke
of ⸺, and inheriting a large property in right
of his mother, Lady Charlotte ⸺, his Grace’s
only child. On being introduced, Beaumont
requested the honour of Lady Frances L.’s hand
in due form, and led her towards the quadrilles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever he addressed her, and that in
consequence she raised her eyes to his face,
she thought she must have seen him before,
but could not remember where. A vague suspicion,
however, sometimes crossed her mind;
yet, if that were the case, the dress was now
so different. Beaumont’s manners were very
animated; and he was so assiduous to please,
that Frances’s natural gaiety of heart, soon appeared
with as little restraint, as if they had
been long acquainted.</p>

<p>“This is not the first effort I have made to
have the honour of being presented to Lady
Frances L.,” said Mr. Beaumont, at last, with
a rather conscious smile, and a little hesitation;
“but I was not quite so fortunate in my former
essay.”</p>

<p>“I thought I had seen you before!” said
Frances. “Then you are the gentleman that
played the flute on the Lake, and that had the
two beautiful dogs, and that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Frances stopped short, for there was something
in the sort of pleasure that Beaumont’s
countenance expressed, which betrayed that he
considered the accuracy of her memory as a
compliment to himself. He immediately perceived
that he had committed an error, which
nothing but the greatest humility could rectify.
With downcast eyes, therefore, he said, “he must
esteem himself fortunate in possessing even dogs,
worthy of being remembered by Lady Frances L.”</p>

<p>Frances was very near being taken in to
believe that she had been guilty of a want of
politeness, in having made leading personages
of the dogs. She was just about to attempt
some qualifying sentence, when, looking up for
the purpose, she perceived, that notwithstanding
the downcast eye, and assumed gravity of
tone, the gratified smile was again stealing over
the lips of Beaumont. She checked herself
immediately, and determined never to have a
good memory again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“This excessive reserve,” (thought Beaumont,
who had perceived both the first movement,
and the change of plan,) “is not a bad
symptom.”</p>

<p>“Now, I have,” he said, looking up again,
and throwing as much gentleness, persuasion,
and humility, into his countenance as possible,
“on some occasions, at least, the most unfashionable
of memories.” He then commenced
a full and accurate account of every time he
had but passed the Lodore house party,
whether riding, driving, walking, or boating;
whereabouts Frances had sat in the boat, what
sort of dress she had worn, &amp;c. At length, by
his animated descriptions, he so far succeeded
in throwing her off her guard, that he sometimes
obtained, by a look or a smile, an inadvertent
acknowledgment that he was right. Slight
as was this encouragement, Beaumont already
fixed his hopes upon it, so prone are young men,
(even the best of them,) to egregious vanity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
His spirits rose, and gave to his manners an
additional vivacity, which seemed to Frances
quite fascinating. She almost felt sorry when
the set was drawing to a conclusion, notwithstanding
her impatience to talk to Edmund
about all that had happened, and express her
own wonder and delight, at things turning out
just as grandmamma and Mr. Jackson always
said they would.</p>

<p>The quadrille ended, she requested Beaumont
to lead her towards Julia and Fitz-Ullin.
This proved no very easy task, and when at
length she did catch a glimpse, at a distance,
of the doleful countenance of his newly elevated
Lordship, she could not help saying to herself,
“Well, certainly, sentimental people are, after
all, sometimes, very tiresome!” The qualifying
expression, sometimes, was put in after the
sentence was commenced, a feeling of affection
for the so long, so dear Edmund, having arisen
and reproached her, for her first movement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
distaste at the sight of a melancholy object, just
at a time, when she was so much inclined to
be pleased. Her agreeable flirtation with her
new acquaintance, however, was not destined
to come to so hasty a conclusion, for the
attempt to join Julia and her partner utterly
failed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“This is too much for human sufferance,</div>
<div class="verse">Despair, rapidly, to an early tomb</div>
<div class="verse">Is carrying thy youth!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, our heroine and Fitz-Ullin, accompanied
many others into a refreshment
room, where they lingered a little, after the
rest of the couples returned to the ball room.</p>

<p>The delay had been more on the part of
Julia than of her companion; for there was an
extraordinary formality and coldness about
his manner, he appeared, as it were, to
wait her commands. His eyes were cast
down, he was silent; not even a catch of
the breath was audible, though more than
once a movement of the chest might have indicated,
to a close observer, that a rising sigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
had been suppressed. “How unlike what Edmund
used to be!” thought Julia. He had
told her, in answer to some one of the obvious
questions she had attempted during the dancing,
that one of his names was still Edmund.</p>

<p>“A strange time this he has chosen,” she
thought, “to become cold and unfriendly to his
oldest friends.” Yet she tried to congratulate
him on the unexpected change in his fortunes,
with much of real kindness, and an effort, at
least, at playfulness of manner; for, thought
Julia, “I must not pretend to understand this
absurd grief about Lady Susan.”</p>

<p>“It is a species of mockery, Julia,” he said,
“to congratulate me on advantages which,
however ardently desired at one period, can
now but aggravate the bitterness of disappointment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Edmund,” said Julia, thrown off her
guard by his look and voice of wretchedness,
“why will you be miserable? Did not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
real regard and friendship of all your early
friends, long, long suffice for your happiness,
and why will you suffer the disappointment of
one, now you see, you—must see—never—well
founded hope, to render valueless every real
good.” But suddenly recollecting that her
kindness was no longer generosity to the poor
friendless Edmund, she checked herself, coloured,
and became silent. Fitz-Ullin seemed
to struggle for some time for composure, or for
voice to reply.</p>

<p>“That one hope, Julia,” he at length articulated
with peculiar bitterness of tone, “however
ill founded you assure me it has ever
been——”</p>

<p>“I assure you!” exclaimed Julia, with some
surprise.</p>

<p>“That one hope,” he continued, speaking
with effort, and from his visibly increasing agitation,
without noticing the interruption, “that
one hope, was all that gave life value in my eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Julia, assuming in her turn
an air of coldness; and, for her, almost
disdain.</p>

<p>“Friendship,” he proceeded, “all I have
ever loved, all I have ever known, all I have
ever been, are too intimately associated with
that one hope, to be remembered without
agony, when separated from it: all must be
resigned together! Would to heaven!” he
added, with energy, “I could first replace
him, whom, most unwillingly, I have destined
to become a wanderer from his long-accustomed
home, and deprived of a rank, without
which, he loathes existence, and which is
valueless to me! But, poor fellow, he would
not retain, for one hour, what he called my
rights. Of his rash attempt at suicide, you are
aware.” Julia bowed her assent. “The
shocking occurrence,” he went on, “took
place, as you also know, just as I was on the
point of setting out for Lodore——.” That,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
thought Julia, I did not know before; but she
felt not very well able to interrupt him; nor
did she deem the circumstance of any importance.</p>

<p>“After which,” continued Fitz-Ullin, “the
imperious necessity of soothing and guarding
my unfortunate friend, lest he should repeat
the attempt on his life, obliged me to have recourse
to writing. You know the rest, Julia.”
His look and manner here, expressed something
of wildness, although, in the arrangement
of his words, there was a forced composure.</p>

<p>“I only know,” she replied, with difficulty
suppressing her tears, “that that letter made me——,”
she was going to have said, very miserable;
but she changed her intention, and said,
“gave me great uneasiness.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I should have caused you pain”
he replied coldly, “but I felt that such an explanation
was due. And now, let me say,
farewell for ever! Without this interview,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
when thousand of miles apart—perhaps—I
should have—I should not have.”</p>

<p>Here he broke off abruptly, and seemed to
struggle with an emotion, difficult to be suppressed.
Of his last speech, Julia had heard,
or at least had comprehended, but the words,
“Farewell for ever!” “I go,” he recommenced,
with a voice so hoarse from emotion,
that it literally could not have been recognized
for his; “I go to-morrow to Lodore, to take
a long farewell of my dearest, most honoured
friend, your revered grandmother: after that,
to sea; to end, I hope, my miserable career, by
dying honourably in the service of my country.”</p>

<p>Ere he concluded, Julia, whose power of
acting composure was totally gone, had covered
her eyes with both her hands, and hid her
face on the arm of the little sofa on which
she was seated; for every thing had begun
to swim before her sight, and she dreaded
exposing her feelings, by, perhaps, fainting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
A sense of coldness passed over her cheeks,
and there was a rushing sound in her ears,
and a confusion in her ideas, which lasted
for some time, and made her uncertain, when
she did begin to revive, how long she had
remained in that painful state. Yet she had,
she found, preserved her sitting posture. She
was even beginning to congratulate herself upon
this circumstance, when she felt an arm which
had hitherto, she now found, been the means
of supporting her, somewhat hastily withdrawn.
Nearly at the same moment, she heard an
approaching step, and a moment after, one
of her hands was taken, but not with Edmund’s
usual gentleness, and pressed to the
lips of one, who now assumed a kneeling
posture, and drew her other hand from
before her eyes. She looked round, and to
her inexpressible surprise and horror, beheld
Henry at her feet, while the figure of our
hero was hastily passing out of the door-way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>When Julia believed it was Edmund, who,
with a manner at which her feelings revolted
she knew not why, had kissed her hand, she
fancied she was shocked at his want of
delicacy; but the bitterness of her disappointment,
when she saw it was Henry, who had
done so, showed how easily Edmund would
have been forgiven.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin did not appear again during the
remainder of the evening. Julia’s indignation
against Henry, aroused her more effectually,
than, perhaps, any thing else could have done.
He answered her warmly-expressed displeasure,
by assuring her, with a diabolical laugh,
that she should not have to complain of his
tenderness much longer.</p>

<p>A second set of quadrilles having by this
time concluded, the refreshment-room was
again crowded, and Lady Julia L. shortly
led back to the dance, attended by a host of
distinguished admirers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What a change.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the sisters retired to their apartment
for the night, Frances’ exuberantly gay
spirits received a sad check; she saw at a
glance, how thoroughly unhappy Julia was.</p>

<p>The extraordinary change in Edmund’s
circumstances, was freely talked over and
wondered at, even in the presence of Alice;
and she ventured to express her joy on the
occasion, and to comment on how delighted
her aunt, and, indeed, every servant at Lodore
would be, when they should hear of what had
happened.</p>

<p>A few moments of silence followed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
dismissal, during which, Frances looked enquiringly
at her sister.</p>

<p>“Well, we have had a full explanation,”
said Julia.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” cried Frances, “and what did
he say, Julia?”</p>

<p>“Oh, treated all the friendship, that all or any
of us could offer him, with sovereign contempt!”</p>

<p>“Impossible! you must have misunderstood
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, there was no room for misunderstanding;
he was explicit enough, I assure you!
Why, he was little short of angry, (as if it
was my fault, that Lady Susan chose to
prefer the Marquis of H.), that hope had
been all, he said, that, in his eyes, gave value
to existence; and he would, therefore, leave
England for ever!” The firmness our heroine
had been affecting, here gave way, and her
voice faltered. Frances embraced her.</p>

<p>“Oh, and he talked all sorts of ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
nonsense,” continued Julia, as she vainly
endeavoured to check her tears, “about dying
an honourable death, and said, that my congratulating
him, on his late good fortune,
was a mockery. I used, I am sure, to pity
him, if he only looked melancholy for a moment;
but really, this caricature, of sorrow, one
cannot sympathise with!” Julia seems to
forget a grand distinction: when she used to
feel such indulgent pity for the melancholy look,
she believed that love, for herself, was its source;
it was quite another thing now; she could see the
folly of being in despair about any body else.</p>

<p>“And what a time,” said Frances, “to
behave ungratefully! It is certainly very
unlike Edmund. Indeed Julia, I think you
must have mistaken him, some way.” Julia
shook her head. “We used, you know, to
imagine,” continued Frances, “that it would be
such a time of rejoicing, whenever Edmund
was discovered to be some great person, (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Mr. Jackson always said would be the case;)
and now, the time is come; and we only seem
to have lost our own Edmund. How could
I have been so mistaken! I was absolutely
certain that he was breaking his heart about his
love for you: yet, if he was, this would not be
the time to be in particular despair about it,
just when, it is most probable, that papa would
give his consent. So, I suppose, I must have
been mistaken.”</p>

<p>Frances had had a thousand things to tell her
sister about her new old acquaintance,
Beaumont; but the melancholy subject they
had been just discussing, and Julia’s tearful
countenance, made her think it all such nonsense,
that she determined not even to mention
the subject.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">… “Why,</div>
<div class="verse">Did I look upon her fatal beauty!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> said, that one of our hero’s appellations,
was still Edmund. Written at full length,
his names and titles are, Edmund-Oscar,
Ormond, Earl Fitz-Ullin. As an infant,
previous to his being stolen from home, he
had always been called Edmund, to please
his mother, from whose father he derived that
name; but, after that Lady’s death, and the
second marriage of the Earl, it became the
custom of the family, to call the nurse’s boy,
(who then filled the place of the stolen child,)
by the name of Oscar, one to which Lord
Fitz-Ullin was partial, as having been frequently
borne by the representatives of the
title.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Our hero remained but one day at Lodore.
To Mrs. Montgomery he explained every
thing, but the cause of his own feelings: the
state of them he did not attempt to hide.
When Mrs. Montgomery spoke of Lady
Susan’s marriage, as the cause of his
despairing letter, he neither confessed that
it was, nor said that it was not. This conduct
the kind old lady construed into a confession,
that she was right. She, accordingly,
after endeavouring to rally him, without being
able to extort a smile, closed the subject, by
gently hinting, that she had expected more
firmness of mind from him: and hoping, that
a little change of scene, would make him,
very shortly, see things in quite another point
of view.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Jackson, who, according to the
determination he expressed on first hearing
Edmund’s letter read, had gone up to town,
even he had not been able to draw forth a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
word on the subject. Once, indeed, Fitz-Ullin
said, after a long reverie, and when
no question had been asked: “The longer I
live, Jackson, the more strongly I feel the excellent
truth of your early lessons; had I
always obeyed the suggestions of conscience,
not only in the letter, but in the spirit; had
the plain road, pointed out by duty, been resolutely
trod; without waiting to inquire of passion,
if there were not a flowery by-path that
would, ultimately, lead to the same end; my
present sufferings had possibly been, at least,
less poignant than they are.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson was, for a moment, puzzled,
almost alarmed. “You can only mean,” he
said, “that it would have been more strictly
honourable in you, to have avoided Lady
Susan’s society, while your birth was unknown,
and your fortune limited—Yet—as things have
turned out—had her Ladyship entertained a
reciprocal preference, why—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“In your kind zeal to place me on good
terms with myself,” said Edmund, mournfully,
“you are becoming a sophist, Jackson!
What had my sense of duty to do with
events which I did not, could not foresee?”</p>

<p>This was a sort of admission, that Mr.
Jackson had been right, in ascribing Edmund’s
wretchedness to his disappointment, about
Lady Susan; but nothing more was said on
the subject then, or at any other time.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin, without evincing any desire to
enjoy his new found rank and fortune, joined
his ship immediately. He seemed to seek
escape, from the mental exertion of considering
whither he should fly, by thus subjecting
himself to the necessity of going wherever,
and doing whatever, the service should require
of him. Among the particulars, respecting
the discovery of our hero’s birth, which the late
circumstances brought to light, it appeared that
his nurse, who, when she wrote to Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Montgomery, thought herself dying, not only
recovered and repented of her repentance,
but married again, a man who would have
made a market of the secret, had Ormond been
without principle. This man was among the
persons, who made the offers already mentioned.
He undertook that his wife, the
nurse, should not be forthcoming; or, that were
she obliged to come forward, she should, on
cross-examination, purposely so contradict
herself, as to invalidate her evidence.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, of his own free will, that
poor Ormond had resigned at once, the rank,
the wealth, and the home, in which he had
from infancy lived, believing them his birth-right.
His twin sister, who was in courtesy
called Miss Ormond, had received a very
superior education, to fit her for the situation
of governess.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable circumstance, that, in
point of fact, the actual fund which had supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
an education, so fatal in its consequences,
was the wages of sin; the very remuneration
bestowed by the munificent Earl, on the dependant
he had seduced. Thus, as by a remarkable
retribution, this command of money
in the hands of the guilty mother, became the
means of blighting the young hearts of both
her ill-fated children, and bringing her own
grey hairs with shame and sorrow to the
grave.</p>

<p>The poor young woman had been settled
for some years, in the capacity of governess, in
a highly respectable private family, at the
time that the marriage between Ormond and
her was attempted; which was one of the reasons
why the wretched mother was not aware
how far matters had gone, till almost the last
moment.</p>

<div class="verse indent14">… Nobles</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> presentation of the sisters took place,
and threw open, at once, the floodgates of
dissipation: while the London season, at its
height, offered all its fascinating varieties. But,
to Julia, every day appeared the same. The
only impression she seemed capable of receiving,
from the ever changing scenes in which
she was engaged, was, from all, a sense of
weariness. The newspapers alone, had power
to interest her; except, that she derived a
melancholy pleasure from listening to the
praises, by Lady Oswald, of Edmund’s generous
kindness to herself, and to her son
Arthur, now our hero’s cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>To Frances, on the contrary, all was novelty
and brilliancy. She never felt so much inclined
to be quite happy; and would have been so,
but for her sympathy with her sister. She
little thought that what so much exhilarated
her spirits, was but the first approach of that
desperate malady, First Love, which, in its more
advanced stage, caused the fixed melancholy
of Julia. Frances found a most agreeable
variety, in the mode of passing her time. Mr.
Beaumont, for instance, could not venture
to call every day, so that the days he did
call, were distinguished by that memorable
event; and the days he did not, by his driving
past under the windows, fifty or an hundred
times in his curricle. Or, they met in the
park; or, danced together at one or more of
the gay engagements of the evening; or, he
found his way into Lord L.’s box at the opera,
or, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Beaumont, whose hopes received so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
support from his vanity, on the very first
evening, found that prop fail him, as his
feelings became more seriously interested; and
doubts and fears accumulated, as the value of
the wished-for object, increased in his estimation.</p>

<p>We pass some splendid alliances, which, it
was evident, would have been offered to Julia,
but for the decided discouragement shown
by her to all. Lord L. too, conscious that
rank and beauty such as Julia’s, when accompanied
by immense fortune, possessed claims
that might, at any time, secure a suitable
establishment, determined not to press upon
her any choice, she did not freely make.
Indeed, his answers to such as requested his
permission to address his daughter, were to
that effect.</p>

<p>We believe that, added to the above reason,
Lord L. had still a lingering wish, of which
he was perhaps unconscious, and for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
he would possibly have found it difficult to
account satisfactorily. We mean, a wish to
see Julia united to Fitz-Ullin; to whom he had
taken an almost unreasonable fancy; considering
how little he had seen of him.</p>

<p>As to Frances, Beaumont’s declared attentions
to her, and her pleased acceptance of
them, kept all others at a distance.</p>

<p>At length the London scene closed, and the
family party returned to Lodore-House, to
celebrate the birth-day, which, by making the
sisters of age, placed their being heiresses to
Lord L.’s extensive estates, beyond contingency;
for, even in the event of their father
marrying again, his whole property was entailed
on the children of his first marriage;
in failure of a son to go, at his death, to such
daughter or daughters, as should live to be of
age, and their heirs for ever. Lord L. had
been too much in love when he married, to
contemplate the possibility of losing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
beautiful young wife, and wishing to marry
again. His Lordship’s lawyers, indeed, attempted
to hint something of the kind; but,
with a countenance of horror, the young lover
had refused to listen to such cold-hearted
suggestions.</p>

<p>Such anniversaries as the present, Mrs.
Montgomery always wished to have kept under
her own roof, where the actual event had
taken place.</p>

<p>Henry had preceded Lord L. and his
daughters into Cumberland; for, either accidentally
or purposely, he had been too late for
the sailing of the Euphrasia.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning after the festival given for the
birth-day, Mrs. Montgomery, partly from having
taken cold, and partly from fatigue, felt far
from well, and consequently remained in bed
the entire of the day. Julia sat with her
grandmother all the morning. After dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Frances relieved guard, and begged of her
sister, as the evening was fine, to take a little
walk.</p>

<p>Lord L. was dining with Lord Borrowdale.
Henry had quitted Lodore-House that morning,
saying, that he was setting out to join the Euphrasia,
which, it appeared by the papers, was
shortly expected in the Sound.</p>

<p>Julia, therefore, walked out quite alone, she directed
her steps towards the desolate vale, where
her mother had first found poor Edmund. She
seated herself. Her eyes rested on the western
hill. It was topped by a few scattered trees, the
grouping and even the ramifications of which,
were accurately traced out by the bright glow
of the heavens behind them. The eastern side
of the slope was in shadow, and the woods that
clothed it hung to the very waters’ edge, while
the lake at its foot, reflecting the crimson clouds
above, appeared a sheet of fire. The dazzle
of the sun’s immediate presence being removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
(for he had just dropped behind the hill,) the
relieved eye could now view with delighted
leisure, all the beauty, magnificence, and infinite
variety of the scene, wherein, each moment,
changes were wrought, imperceptible in their
approaches, but in their effects, picturesque
and splendid, as the most vivid descriptions of
enchantment.</p>

<p>Amid the clouds, cloud-formed castles turreted
with gold, and temples, sustained by
pillars which seemed of fire, arose, spread,
united, brightened, divided, and sunk again.
Imagination could fancy them dissolving in the
intensity of their own lustre. Where these
had been, mimic vessels now appeared, of fleecy
whiteness, sailing on the liquid gold. These
melted next, and waves of clouds, rolling themselves
together heap on heap, rose to mountains
ranged across the west, and shutting out almost
all its glories. Yet on their purple summits,
there seemed to linger floating forms, still of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
vivid hues, though each moment losing something
of their brightness, till, gradually, they
became of a sombre grey, as, one by one, they
clothed themselves in mist, and, blending with
the deepening shadows, disappeared. The
upper sky, however, was still streaked with
alternate grey and gold, which the face of the
water, faithfully as a mirror, reflected. The
real mountains which surrounded the lake, and
the little islands which lay slumbering on its
surface, had become masses of an almost jetty
black, and there was little light remaining any
where, when a solitary row-boat put off from
the opposite shore. As it crossed one of the
illumined paths, which reflected from the sky
still appeared on the water, the working of its
oars was, for the moment, visible, together with
the strongly defined form of one who, with
folded arms, stood erect at its bow. Julia certainly
saw, for the moment described, as we
see with the mind’s eye what crosses us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
thought, the boat, and the figure, for the
appearance they made at the time afterwards
floated on her memory. Yet she remained motionless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> became dark, the usual hour for tea at
Lodore-house approached. The drawing-room
was lit for the purpose, the tea equipage
placed, and, finally, the steaming urn brought
in. Still there was no person in the room.</p>

<p>At length Frances entered. She looked
round with some surprise. She approached
the table, and touched lightly, with her taper
finger, the side of the tea-pot. Finding it cold,
she wondered that Julia had not made tea.
She rang the bell, and desired that Lady Julia
might be called. Alice was sent to Julia’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
room. Julia was not there, but three notes
were found, conspicuously placed, on her dressing
table, one directed to her father, one to
her grandmother, and one to her sister. They
were all couched in gentle and affectionate terms.
The attachment which had induced her to the
present step, she said, had long subsisted. She
had only waited to be of age. They should hear
from her shortly, she added, when she should
give them an address, by which she should
get their letters, without their knowing where
to find her; for that she meant to remain in
concealment, till they had all pronounced her
free pardon, were it for years!</p>

<p>This discovery produced the greatest consternation.
What was to be done?—As a first
step, Lord L. was sent for.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left Julia seated on the shore of the lake.
She had certainly seen, for one short moment,
the boat with the figure standing in it, but had,
it would seem, lost again the consciousness of
what she had seen, in the deep reverie of her
own thoughts.</p>

<p>She remained on the same spot, though the
darkness thickened around her, till there was
scarce a ray of even twilight left.</p>

<p>She was at length aroused, by hearing near
her the splash of oars. Looking towards the
sound, she could just discern close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
shore, a boat, its dark dimensions made visible
by the comparative light of the water’s
surface; while, at the same instant, the figure
of a man, in a great cloak, which spread
abroad like immense black wings, alit beside
her, as if from the air. The effect was produced
by the flying leap of one who, from the
boat, by aid of a long pole, flung himself to
land.</p>

<p>The next moment, Julia found herself lifted
into the boat, and the next, the pole had forced
the keel off the gravelly beach, and the oars
were plying with an eagerness which defeated
the intended purpose, for they rather glanced
upon, than laid hold of the water, till a voice
of thunder, with a sort of explosion, cursed
the awkwardness of the rowers, and the plunges
became heavier and more regular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord</span> L. now arrived at Lodore-house. The
dreadful intelligence was given, the notes
shewn. He was stunned, it was entirely incredible.
He roused himself, and was incensed.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that it was with
Henry she had eloped, notwithstanding all her
declarations of indifference towards him. These,
it was now evident, had only been made to
throw her friends off their guard, and gain
time, till, by being of age, she was enabled to
act in defiance of her father, without forfeiting
her property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>While calling for his horses, he made some
breathless inquiries among the servants.</p>

<p>No one had seen Lady Julia come in, since
she had walked out immediately after dinner.
Alice had attended on that occasion with her
walking things. She declared that the notes
were not on the table, when her young Lady
went out, and that the drawers which were now
open and empty were then shut; and that the
jewel-box, which was now gone, was then in
one of the drawers, which she had opened to
take out a pair of gloves, and afterwards locked
again. It would thence appear, that Julia, or
some one entrusted by her with her keys, must
have returned privately, previous to her final
departure, and taken away such of her clothes,
trinkets, &amp;c., as she wished to carry with her.</p>

<p>Lord L. was now on horseback. Also Mr.
Jackson, who, as usual on all emergencies, had
been summoned.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boat which had borne Julia from the vale
of Borrowdale, now neared a very wild part of
the further shore. One of the rowers grappling
the bank with a boat-hook, the boat fell
alongside the rocks. The person who seemed
to command the others stood up, shook the
immense folds of his cloak, lifted Julia to land,
and holding her trembling arm firmly within
his, hurried her up the rugged coast. They
were soon in a narrow valley, resembling the
chasm which it may be supposed the rending
in twain of a mountain might form. The
stranger whistled, and was answered by a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sound, which seemed to proceed from
within that portion of the mountain, which, its
rough and shaggy face studded with jutting
rocks, and hung with underwood, rose
almost perpendicularly on their left.</p>

<p>On turning round one of the most considerable
of those projections, a stream of light
crossed the path a little way before them,
though the source whence it came was not
yet visible. They continued to approach
the spot; and now a clanking of chains was
heard, soon after which, they arrived at
the entrance of a cavern, the interior of which
was strongly illuminated by a large faggot fire.</p>

<p>Here a most extraordinary apparition presented
itself. It was in the act of coming
forward from a distant part of the cave. On
reaching about its centre, it halted. It either
was, or from the lowness of the roof and
strangeness of the light, it appeared to be, of
gigantic stature; the very shadow which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
cast traversed the floor, and rose over the
arched side, dilating and contracting as the
blazes of the faggots moved; and throwing
all behind it into the deepest gloom.</p>

<p>The appearance we are describing, did not
owe its whole bulk to one object; but whether
what seemed to be the principal being of the
composite monster, was male or female, mortal
or devil, it was not very easy to determine. It
was seated upright, and in masculine fashion,
on the back of a creature little removed from
the living skeleton of a horse. It wore, what
seemed to have been intended, more in
mockery than in modesty, for a petticoat;
which piece of feminine attire being, by the
mode of sitting adopted by the rider, rendered
of little avail, a considerable portion of sooty
coloured but fleshy limbs were visible; while
arms of a like description were planted, what
is vulgarly termed a-kimbo. The countenance
also partaking of the Ethiop’s hue, the blackened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
eyelids gave an additional glare to the
impudent glee of the eye, and the sooty lips,
spread by a grin indicative of coarse mirth,
displayed teeth, to which contrast gave a dazzling
whiteness; yet which served but to light
up a thick-lipped mouth, the expression of
which inspired a feeling of disgust it is impossible
to define. The rest of the features,
had a dauntless bearing, a certain fearlessness
superadded to their shamelessness. This
latter characteristic, indeed, pervaded the
whole air of a figure, which was crowned by a
mis-shapen and much abused man’s hat, worn
on one side of the head. It happened to be
that which was in shadow, while the brow on
the side next to the burning faggots, the cheek
on the same side, the chin, the swell also of
the limbs, the folds of the petticoat; all, in
short, which rounded or protruded, was so
curiously bronzed by the golden glare of the
fire-light, that the whole apparition had much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the effect of a great equestrian metal cast,
magically gifted with life; for the horse too, if
horse it might be called, partook of the partial
illumination.</p>

<p>The animal was large boned and stood
high, whilst its heavy head hanging to its
shrunken neck, nearly touched the ponderous
hoof of the advanced fore-foot. It was blind
of one eye, and dim from behind a filmy mist,
gleamed the spark of life which still remained
in the other. Its shoulders were galled, its
knees broken, and its gaunt and extraordinary
appearance completed by the uncommon
accoutrement of weighty iron chains, which
hung trailing on the ground on either side.</p>

<p>The thus unenviably mounted rider had
paused, as has been already noticed, in the centre
of the cave, when our heroine and her
conductor presented themselves at its mouth.
On their entering, a loud coarse laugh echoed
round the vault, which through all its hoarseness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and discordance, had just enough of the
tones of a female voice, to insult every association
on the subject of woman’s loveliness.
Our equestrian, towards whom we fear we
must in future use a feminine pronoun, kicked
the creature on which she was mounted, with
both the heels of her iron-shod wooden shoes.
This appeared to be a signal well understood
between the parties; for the wretched animal
immediately commenced its operations by lifting
one of its heavy hinder feet, placing it on
the shaggy fetlock of one of the fore ones, and
stumbling.</p>

<p>“Dang thee, thoo deevil!” she exclaimed,
pulling him up by a bridle of rope, which
served, on occasion, the double purpose of
whip, never being required but about the neck
and shoulders, the above noticed method with
the heels, serving to enliven the hinder parts.</p>

<p>In a voice of thunder, the ruffian, who still
held Julia’s arm fast within the folds of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
cloak, uttered the monosyllable, “Stop!” He
was obeyed, and now received from the hands
of his mounted assistant, a parcel, containing
a bonnet and cloak of the commonest description.
These he commanded Julia to put on;
and roughly assisting in removing those she
had worn for her evening walk, he flung them
into the fire, where they were quickly consumed.</p>

<p>During the moment that intervened between
the taking off one muffle, and the close wrapping
of her form in the other, a painter might
have found a striking subject in the uncongeniality
with the surrounding scene, and contrast
with the fierce and coarse actors in it,
of Julia’s entire appearance. The youthful
grace of her figure, simply but elegantly
dressed, in that most becoming of all costumes—a
summer evening home half-dress of
soft white muslin; while the noble as well as
lovely countenance, the fair throat, the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
hair, were also (by the temporary removal
of the bonnet as well as cloak) fully displayed.
Another moment, and our heroine’s coarse
disguise had converted the gentle vision into
the similitude of a market-woman, or farmer’s
servant. Her terrific waiting-man, who had
stood in the stead of waiting-maid, on the
completion of her metamorphosis, lifted her
from the ground, and placed her on the shoulders
of the horse, where, immediately, the
rough sooty arm of the rider, with the
muscles of a blacksmith, and the flesh of a
woman, was wrapped tightly round her
waist.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two fellows who had rowed
the boat entered. The glare of light which
now fell on their faces and figures, shewed
them to be of the same tribe of savages to
which belonged the woman already described.
The chief distinction was, that they wore not
the sole female attribute displayed by her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the petticoat. The covering substituted by
them consisting of a scanty species of soot-coloured
shirt and drawers, leathern aprons,
and a quantity of jet black dust. Their sinewy
arms were bare, the shirt-sleeve being pushed
up to the shoulder, while the front part of the
same garment hung loosely open down to the
girdle, exhibiting an abundant growth of such
covering as nature sometimes bestows on bipeds
of this description, in common with the four-footed
race. Beards of unchecked luxuriance
covered their chins and upper lips, bushy
whiskers met the beards, and the long, wild,
disorderly hair of the heads, crowning all,
left little that could be called face. That
little was either black or blackened, and gave
to the eyes, as they reflected back the fire-light,
something of the appearance already
remarked in those of the female: in point of
expression, however, theirs, instead of the
gleeful leer of unshrinking impudence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
characterized her’s, had the quick pursuing
flash of ferocity.</p>

<p>“All right?” demanded the mysterious
stranger, as they appeared. “Awe right!”
they replied, and passed on, till their figures
were lost in the darkness which veiled the
distant part of the cave. From thence a
clanking of chains was soon heard, and shortly
after the savage forms re-appeared; but now
mounted on animals so like the one already
described, that an enumeration of their points
would be unnecessary. One of the fellows
also led a horse of a rather better description,
which the commander of the party took
from him, and mounted. The cavalcade now
quitted the cavern.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Wherefore comest thou, lovely maid, I said,</div>
<div class="verse">Over rocks, over mountains, why art thou</div>
<div class="verse">On the desert hill, why on the heath alone?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span> and her conductors proceeded at a
quicker pace than the first appearance of their
horses promised. Their way lay over a ridge
of mountains; both the ascent and descent
were rugged and dangerous in the extreme,
and occupied some hours. At length Julia
became sensible that they were crossing a wide
common.</p>

<p>She looked anxiously round for some human
habitation, but could discover nothing indicative
of cultivation or of life, except that almost
at the verge of the horizon, as well as at a
considerable distance from each other, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
descried three great fires, close to each of
which arose a single round tower, with a large
mound beside it. Gradually, the party seemed
to be approaching nearer and nearer to one
of these towers. Julia could at length distinguish
dark figures, moving between her
sight and the light of the fire, which light had
from the first rendered the tower a conspicuous
object. She felt a slight sensation of hope
revive within her, but determined to make no
attempt to call for assistance, till certain that
she was near enough to be heard, lest her
cries should be forcibly stifled as they had been
at first. They now arrived close to the
tower and fire. Figures (but alas! too like
those in whose hands she already was,)
moved on the top of the mound, around a
circle which yet none seemed to enter. Slight
as was the hope which the sight of such beings
could inspire, Julia now cried for help. The
figures on the mound immediately whirled their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
caps in the air, huzzaed, and as the wild sound
died away, broke into brutal laughter.</p>

<p>Julia became instantly silent as death. Her
principal conductor dismounting, lifted her
from the horse, and taking a firm grasp of
her arm, dragged her up the mound. It
seemed formed of some loose material, which
gave way under her feet, and brought her to
her knees more than once.</p>

<p>Arrived at the top, Julia perceived that she
stood on the edge of a circular opening or pit,
which, from the dark vacuum that met the eye,
appeared bottomless. She shrunk back, and
clung, as if for protection, even to the ruffian
who had led her to its verge.</p>

<p>At this moment, a huge dark object passed
through the air over their heads with a
swinging motion, and then descended over
the mouth of the pit. It was a black formless
machine, hollow within, and suspended from
above by chains. The stranger lifted Julia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from her feet, placed her in it, then stepped in
himself, and it instantly began to descend.
He stood firmly and still held her arm, that,
as she too was obliged to stand, she might not
by the motion lose her balance. With an
involuntary impulse of terror, she looked over
the side of the machine; all below was darkness.
With a despairing gaze she raised her
eyes, and fixed them on the round aperture
above. It appeared to lessen every moment,
while the voices of those they had left on the
brink grew fainter and fainter. They continued
descending, and at length, a confused
hum arose from below. They descended still,
and gradually, the mingled din increased both
in loudness and distinctness, till the clanking
of chains and strokes of hammers could be
distinguished, through shrieks, yells, and
coarse wild laughter.</p>

<p>Still they descended, and now, in his usual
voice of thunder, Julia’s companion uttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a strange halloo, which bellowed fearfully in
the narrow void to which its echoes were confined.
It seemed to be a summons to hitherto
invisible beings, for immediately, a glare of
unnatural light appeared below, and, moving
through it, fiend-like forms as black as ebony.</p>

<p>They received and steadied the machine as
it rested on the ground, and then, on beholding
what were its contents, set up loud
laughter, accompanied by huzzas. The
stranger looked fiercely at them, which seemed
a little to check their mirth. Julia, instead
of closing her eyes or fainting, was for the
moment roused by despair, to a peculiarly
vivid reception of surrounding impressions.
And strange were the sights that met her gaze.
The most fearfully gloomy vaults spread on
every side; their low roofs, sustained by
immense pillars of shining jet. The flooring,
the walls, the roofing, every where of the same
material. Long low aisles or passages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
branching of in various directions, some lost
in total darkness; in others, the view terminated
by a far perspective, dimly illuminated,
and filled with moving shadowy forms, the
black countenances invisible through the obscurity,
while the numberless eyes, that seemed
scintillations from the unearthly lights the place
afforded, were scattered over the gloomy
region, like stars in the dark vault of midnight.
To complete the wild effect of the whole scene,
these terrific beings were all busily employed
excavating on every side, as if to increase the
dimensions of their infernal realm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“More fire than lustre had his eye, his form</div>
<div class="verse">Less grace than grandeur.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Why am I summoned here, to mix with thine</div>

<div class="verse">Of Moma?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Near</span> one of the entrances to ⸺haven, the
chimneys and slating of a miserable looking
row of houses, appear quite at the feet of the
traveller; consequently, on a level with the
road which runs along the brow of the hill, in
the side of which the backs of the houses are
sunk, while their faces front the valley.</p>

<p>About an hour after the conclusion of the
events related in our last chapter, but still
before day-break, a horseman approached at
a rapid pace along the road just described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
He turned the animal suddenly down a narrow
rugged abrupt descent, which brought him
immediately in front of the said row of houses.</p>

<p>The rider stopped, and, loosing his foot
from the stirrup at the side nearest the miserable
dwelling, close to which his horse now
stood, kicked the door. It opened, and a
figure appeared, the outlines of which, as
shewn by the light from behind, were easily to
be recognised, as those of the female equestrian.
From the length of time, however, which has
elapsed, it may not be quite so easy to trace in
her that bold strolling thief and beggar, whom
we have seen in the very first chapter of this
history, treat poor Edmund so cruelly. Yet
she is the same individual. By origin she was,
what in Cumberland is called, a bottom lass;
the most opprobrious of terms, meaning one of
those creatures, found to swarm in that region
of darkness, denominated, in the country of
which we speak, “the bottom.” Creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
who, if they can claim a mother for the first
few weeks after their birth, rarely can
a father.</p>

<p>We are not aware that the profligate being
whose history we are thus tracing back, was
ever christened; yet, in some way or other,
she had obtained the appellation of Jin of the
Gins.</p>

<p>Jin, notwithstanding her lack of noble birth,
happened to possess, in extreme youth, some
natural beauty; and by that circumstance was
promoted, at the early age of seventeen, to the
rank of nominal wife to a travelling tinker.
With him, for a few years, she travelled,
begged, pilfered, and drank.</p>

<p>During this period it was that Edmund had,
for the sake of his fine clothes, become her
prey. Shortly after having abandoned him,
she was caught in the act of achieving a more
than usually daring robbery, for which she
must have been hung, had she not escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
from the magistrates before she could be committed
to the county jail. On this occasion she
returned, at about three and twenty, to her old
asylum, the bottom; where, shrouded in coal-dust
and darkness, she has, up to the present
period, which brings her to about the age of
three or four and forty, laboured at bottom-work
in the bowels of the earth, and often
beneath the bed of the ocean, amid hundreds
of her own description.</p>

<p>To account for the equestrian prowess of
Jin of the Gins, we must here remark, that
near to ⸺haven, and not far from the row
of houses just described, there is a broad
covered way, leading down to the works by a
descent so gradual, that horses, cars, and even
waggons can enter by it; while daily may be
seen emerging from it troops of colliers,
mounted on such animals as in a late chapter
we have described, accoutred too with chains
which, like the traces of a just-loosed carriage-horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
trail on either side, ready to hook to
cars, waggons, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But to return to the scene which was just
commencing. The rider, in answer to whose
summons we left Jin in the act of opening the
door, on the threshold of which she now stood,
accosted her thus, “Well, Jin of the Gins,
how is it with you?”</p>

<p>“Nane the bether for yeer axin,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Is Sir Sydney come?” continued the
querist.</p>

<p>“Comed!” she repeated, “Aye, and maire
nor him.”</p>

<p>Our traveller threw his bridle to the gentle
groom, whistled, advanced a foot over the
threshold, and paused in the act, till he heard
an answering whistle from within. He then
proceeded, and entering a miserably small
earthen-floored apartment, on the side of the
passage, stood before Julia’s late conductor.
This mysterious personage was still wrapped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
his boat cloak. He sat leaning on a little
rickety round table, whereon was placed a
lantern which suffered but little of the light it
contained to escape, having, in place of glass,
sides of rusty tin, perforated with small holes
like those of a colander.</p>

<p>“You have secured her, then?” said the
traveller, as he entered.</p>

<p>“Where is Lord L.?” inquired the stranger,
without rising or noticing the question put to
him.</p>

<p>“Pursuing on a wrong track,” replied the
traveller.</p>

<p>“Have you brought the title-deeds?” demanded
the stranger, in a tone that few would
have liked to have answered with a negative.
The traveller unbuttoned his great coat and
took off his hat. It was Henry!</p>

<p>“I have,” he replied, after a moment of
hesitation, and slowly undoing a button or two
of the inner coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give them to me, then!” said the stranger
fiercely.</p>

<p>Henry drew a parcel of parchments halfway
from his breast, then paused.</p>

<p>“What do you hesitate about, Sir?” said
the stranger.</p>

<p>“I do not mean,” commenced Henry, “to
sell the Craigs at present.”</p>

<p>“What of that?” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“You shall have the half of the rents,” continued
Henry, in an expostulating tone, “and
when, at Lord L.’s death, she inherits her
proportion of his estates, then the Scotch
acres may go to the hammer, and you shall
have the whole of the money they bring.”</p>

<p>The stranger, while with his eyes fixed on
the face of the speaker, he listened, had been
slowly extracting a brace of pistols from his
pockets, and laying them on the table.</p>

<p>“And pray what security have I for all this
unless the title-deeds are in my own possession?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
he demanded scornfully, and with
affected coolness. Then, with a sudden yell
of rage, resembling the neigh of a wild horse,
and grinning in a terrific manner, he vociferated,
“Lay down the parchments, Sir!”
striking the table as he spoke so violently with
his clenched hand, that the lantern spun round
like a child’s top; and one of the pistols
leaping to the ground, went off.</p>

<p>Henry took the packet from his breast, and
laid it down in silence.</p>

<p>The stranger drew it towards him, unfolded
it, and corrected its tendency to relapse into
its former folds, by laying his pistols on either
margin, picking up for the purpose the one
which had fallen. He then proceeded to open
the door of the lantern, whence poured a
powerful but partial light on the writings,
and on his own countenance, as he bent over
them in the act of examining their contents.
A fur travelling cap, with a band tight to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
forehead, displayed, fully, features of terrific
strength, and which, at the same time, presented
a horrible sort of caricature of manly
beauty, distorted almost to wildness by the
habitual exaggeration of every desperate feeling.
The scrutiny of the documents occupied
some time, during the whole of which Henry
stood, and was silent. The stranger having
completed his task, refolded the parchments,
and placed them in his breast; then, closing
the lantern, and restoring thus the scene of
conference to its former state of twilight, he
re-charged the pistol, which had gone off
in its fall, placing it with its companion in
his pockets, and while doing so, said in a
somewhat pacified tone: “These deeds will
not enable me to sell the estate without
your concurrence; though, their being
in my hands, will secure me against your
doing so without mine. I shall be perfectly
satisfied, at present, with half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
rents; but, that I may have no doubt or
difficulty in receiving the said moiety, you
must, as soon as the marriage shall be
proved——.”</p>

<p>“Have you procured witnesses?” interrupted
Henry.</p>

<p>“I have: they are to meet us at ⸺.”</p>

<p>“Will they swear direct, that the ceremony
was performed without unwillingness on her
part, or compulsion on ours?”</p>

<p>“Certainly! What else are they paid for?”</p>

<p>“And that will be sufficient?”</p>

<p>“Together with the certificate of the clergyman
and clerk.”</p>

<p>“The clergyman is my old chum—of
course?” said Henry. “He would, I know,
have no scruples, were she gagged and handcuffed
at the altar!”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied the stranger.
“But, to return to my subject: As soon as
the marriage shall have been proved, so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to entitle you to a legal controul over the
property, you must employ a proper agent,
give him sufficient powers and directions, to
one-half of each year’s rent to an address
through which I can receive it without reference
to you, and the other half to an address
by which you can receive it, without making
your actual residence known (that is, should
concealment long continue necessary). Have
you any hope of reconciling Julia herself?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest!” returned Henry.
“When, indeed, she has been my wife,” he
continued, “long enough to be, perhaps, a
mother, she may not choose the publicity of
a trial. Indeed, by that time, neither my
aunt, nor even Lord L. himself, could wish,
I should think, to go to extremities with so
near a relation: even were the whole truth
to come out. In short, it could answer no
desirable purpose! Lord L. must know that
his daughter would be more respectable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the eyes of the world as my wife, and supposed
to be willingly so, than by seeking any
redress the law could then give her, were it
even possible to procure full evidence that
the marriage was compulsory, which I expect
we shall render impossible: so that I have no
fears on that score. The three notes this
evening (for I left my fellow behind on pretext
of bringing my luggage) passed examination.
I shall, therefore, have no difficulty, while
abroad, in keeping up a regular correspondence
in her name with all her friends. In short,
when the numberless circumstances, however
trivial in themselves, which I have now for so
long caused to bear on the one point, receive this
last crowning evidence, there will not remain
the shadow of a doubt on the mind of any
one, that Julia has only waited to be of age
to elope with me. I expect, in fact, that the
conviction on the mind of every one will be
so strong, that they will not think it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to examine into any thing; and that one-half
the precautions we have taken will prove quite
unnecessary. It is not at all unlikely, too, that
after a time she may, for the sake of being
permitted to return to this country, and reside
near her friends, consent to declare, personally,
I mean, to her own family, that she
married me willingly; in which case, we could
take up our residence at the Craigs.”</p>

<p>“In short,” continued Henry, “once she is
in my power, I can compel her to do any
thing! How is she to help herself I’d be glad
to know?”</p>

<p>“Fitz-Ullin is expected in the Sound, I find,”
said the stranger, “what a confounded untimely
blow that old beldam’s confession was!
By the bye, I shall expect to be repaid the
sums I have been obliged to give Jin of the
Gins, to keep her silent till after your marriage;
and now that she has been forestalled,
(which was always what she feared,) and can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
never get any thing from either party, her
demands for compensation will be exorbitant.
Those, however, you must satisfy, now that
you will have funds.”</p>

<p>“How long is it now,” said Henry, “since
she first consulted you on the possibility of
making a market of her secret, without getting
hanged.”</p>

<p>“A few weeks,” replied the stranger, “previous
to that cursed masquerade at Arandale,
when I wrote to you on the subject of the admission
ticket.”</p>

<p>“That then was the first intimation you
had,” said Henry, musing. “Had it not been,”
he added, after a short silence, “for the fortunate
chance of Ormond shooting himself, all
must certainly have been lost.”</p>

<p>“There was too much left to chance in that
business,” retorted the stranger. “That night
at Arandale should have rid us of all anxiety
on the subject. I ought to have answered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
first question by blowing out his brains! And
that, before I palsied my arm with that cursed
fencing! Never, certainly, were there time
and place so well calculated for committing an
act of the kind with perfect impunity. Since
then, it has never been possible to get near
him, with any thing like a chance of escape.
I deserved, however, to fail for using such
pitiful half measures, where so much was at
stake.”</p>

<p>“I never thought his removal so very necessary,”
observed Henry.</p>

<p>“Fool!” replied the stranger, “How, if the
public disclosure had been made under almost
any other circumstances? When
can you come to ⸺?” he added.</p>

<p>“I must first,” replied Henry, “join the
Euphrasia, to avoid, in case of failure, any
thing like proof against me. It is impossible
for her to have the most remote guess who you
are, so that were she even to escape, while she
had not yet seen me, all would still be safe!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
In short, we had better not meet even for a
moment, till we meet at the altar.”</p>

<p>The stranger paused, as if considering the
subject; then, standing up, said, “True! you
set out immediately.”</p>

<p>Henry replied in the affirmative; and thus
they parted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Julia began to recover sensation, she
found herself in a reclining position, while
the object on which her eyes first opened,
appeared to her bewildered imagination, to
be the mast of the boat in which she had
so lately sat. And, indeed, the wreck of
what had once been a bed, on which she
now lay, having neither curtains nor top, the
one naked foot-post which remained standing
was not very unlike the single mast of a
small boat. The apartment was without
other furniture. The ceiling, or rather roofing,
consisted of the inside of the slating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
which descending obliquely from the opposite
wall, passed close over Julia’s face, and
met the floor just behind her head. In the
centre of the floor, which was laden with
straw and dust, was an open trap door with
the head of a ladder appearing a foot or two
above it, while on one corner or shaft of
the said head of the ladder, hung a lantern,
the only source of light the apartment could
boast.</p>

<p>The first sounds that blended themselves
with the returning perceptions of our heroine,
were those of a soft, and she thought, well
known voice, repeating in a tone, the most
heart-broken, “Poor child! poor child!” She
withdrew her eyes from the contemplation of
the bed, and thought she beheld Mrs.
Montgomery leaning over her. But when her
ideas and her sense of sight both became a
little clearer, she perceived that the figure she
thus beheld, was not only that of a stranger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
but of a being which, now that it ceased to
move, scarcely seemed to live, the shadow only
of a human form. Yet did the countenance
possess a power over Julia like that of a spell,
she could not withdraw her gaze from it. The
hollow cheek, the large prominent eye, with
hopelessness for its sole expression, the colourless
lip, the perfectly white hair, the small and
still delicate, while emaciated throat, formed
a picture, which could not be contemplated
without extreme pain.</p>

<p>Julia half raising herself, exclaimed, “Where
am I? where am I? oh, where am I?” each time
with increasing earnestness. Her companion
was silent. “Tell me, tell me, where I am!”
No reply. Again she repeated her inquiries,
her voice and manner becoming wild with
anxiety and dread.</p>

<p>A sudden, loud, and undefinable sound, accompanied
by a pistol shot, was heard from
below. The hitherto motionless form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
silent vision shuddered universally. The faint
tinge of life which was stealing over the cheek
of Julia fled.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Euphrasia, according to the expectation
announced in the papers, arrived in Plymouth
Sound. She had on board a number of prisoners,
taken out of two prizes she had lately
captured, but which had been so much disabled,
that it had been impossible to prevent
their going to the bottom. Lady Oswald,
who had taken up her residence at Stonehouse
for the purpose of being near a great sea-port,
and having thus opportunities of sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
seeing her son, on understanding that the
vessel was out in the Sound, but was to sail
again immediately, went on board in a shore
boat.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin had communicated with the
Admiral, and had received orders (all the
prison-ships being full) to proceed to Leith,
and dispose of his prisoners there.</p>

<p>Lady Oswald had been long wishing to visit
Scotland for the purpose of making enquiries
respecting the property which she thought
ought to be her son’s. Dread of the expenses
of the journey, and the want of any friend to
assist her in an undertaking almost hopeless,
had hitherto delayed her project. This was,
therefore, just the thing for her; she could
now go to Edinburgh free of expense, and in
the society of her best friend; that nephew,
whose liberality was the sole support both of
herself and her son. Her son too would thus
be with her. Such an opportunity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
not to be lost! Her wishes were of course
acceded to by Fitz-Ullin, and a ship’s boat sent
ashore for her maid, and such apparel as might
be necessary for the voyage. In a few hours
the Euphrasia sailed. That night, a little
before twelve, she fell in with a kind of armed
smuggler, evidently bound for the coast of
France. The smuggler refused to come to, or
answer signals, and even attempted to make
sail; a temerity which obliged the frigate to
fire on a little vessel, that should have suffered
herself to have been captured without making
any resistance.</p>

<p>A few carronades, of course, overwhelmed
the smuggler. Her crew immediately took to
their boats, which they had lowered down on
the first alarm.</p>

<p>As the thunder of the frigate’s guns had subsided,
all sound concluded in the last faint
reverberation of a cry of distress, from apparently
a single female voice, on board the else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
forsaken vessel. The smuggler was already,
to all appearance, on fire at one end. Fitz-Ullin
perceiving this, and hearing or fancying the
cry, obeyed an involuntary impulse, and leaped
into one of the boats manning to pursue the
fugitives, and ordered it alongside the burning
vessel.</p>

<p>“They have not boats enough for all,” he
said, “and have left some wretches behind to
perish.” The next moment he was on board,
followed but by a couple of sailors, who were
bold enough not to be deterred by the volumes
of portentous smoke. Assisted by these two
men, he searched the upper deck, calling out
frequently that there was a boat alongside.
No one answered, the smuggler seemed wholly
deserted, and the sailors urged the necessity
of returning to the boat. Fitz-Ullin bid them
do so, but not feeling quite satisfied while
they were getting over the side he ran below.
To his infinite surprise the door of the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
was fast. He forced it. All was darkness,
though the fire was increasing rapidly at the
other end of the ship.</p>

<p>Something that lay on the cabin floor impeded
the opening of the door. He stooped,
and found it to be the body of one, apparently
lifeless, for there was neither breath nor motion.
He raised it: from the dress and its
lightness, it seemed that of a very young lad.
Life, however, might be but suspended, not
extinct; he determined therefore to convey the
unconscious object of his charitable solicitude,
into the boat. The fire was fast approaching,
and the smoke, in consequence,
becoming suffocating. Fitz-Ullin hurried
on deck, carrying the body with him:
while cautiously descending to the boat in
waiting, he fancied he could feel a scarcely
perceptible heaving motion, swell the bosom
of his hitherto lifeless burden, as though it
were beginning to breathe. Arrived in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
boat, he laid the body with great care, partly
on the bench beside him, supporting the
shoulders and head across his knees; and,
intending to chafe the temples, drew off a
tight cloth cap, such as cabin boys wear;
when, a profusion of long hair, which, but for its
fairness, had not been discernible, so dark was
the night, fell over his arm. Almost at the
same moment, the flames of the burning vessel
which had hitherto been darting singly through
volleys of thick smoke, burst into an universal
blaze! and, in its fierce glare, the mild features
and sparkling hair of Julia, lay displayed before
the astonished Fitz-Ullin, her head resting on
his arm! The news of her having been
carried off from Lodore had not reached him,
so that his amazement was complete. To say
he could not speak, would be but imperfectly
to describe him; he could not think! if he had
any idea, it was an undefined one, that he
either dreamed or was deranged. Julia’s eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
opened. For a few moments, they had no
speculation in them: she looked stedfastly in
his face. Then her features lit up suddenly,
with a wildness of joy, of fear, and of confidence,
so strangely blended, that it was almost
like insanity. She caught at the hand that
supported her with both of hers, clung to it,
and, with the most piteous earnestness of entreaty,
cried, “What is it? What is it? Oh,
what is it all?”</p>

<p>He tried in the gentlest manner, both to calm
her excessive agitation, and to make her understand
that she had been just taken out of
the burning vessel they were now leaving behind
them, pointing towards it, as he spoke.
She looked at it, first with little visible perception
of what it meant; then, covering her eyes
a moment, she seemed to think; then, starting,
and looking all around, she said, “But where
is she? Did she not come out of it too?”
Fitz-Ullin explained to her, that the vessel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
evidently deserted by every one else, when he
found her locked up in the cabin. “She was in
the cabin with me!” said Julia, with alarming
wildness of manner; then, clasping her hands,
she cried vehemently, “Come back for her!
Come back for her! oh, come back!”</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin, for reply, pointed again to the
mass of devouring flames which floated on the
water, enlightening its dark surface to a
considerable distance. Julia involuntarily
stretched her arms over the side of the boat,
towards the terrific object, as though she could
thus assist, and remained fixed in an agony of
helpless horror, unconscious of her own attitude,
rendered peculiarly conspicuous by the
powerful light which necessarily fell on her uplifted
countenance, and the palms, and points
of the fingers of her outstretched hands; whilst
her figure, in the dark boat-cloak in which
Fitz-Ullin had wrapped it, was lost to view.</p>

<p>In a few seconds, the condensed body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
fire, with an explosion like thunder, parted in
ten thousand pieces, each and all, resembling
so many flaming torches, flew upwards, and
passing each other through the dark atmosphere
in circling arches, descended again to
the surface of the water, gleamed there half a
moment, and became extinct. Pitchy darkness
succeeded to the unnatural glare, which had lit
up the scene but a moment before, for no
vestige of the conflagration remained.</p>

<p>Poor Julia fortunately found, for her horror-stricken
and terrified feelings, the only relief
of which they were susceptible, in a passion of
tears, as profusely shed as those of a child.</p>

<p>She clung to Fitz-Ullin with an alarming
convulsiveness of grasp. In his endeavours to
sooth and calm her, and the bewilderment of
his exaggerated fears, for the possible consequences
of the state in which she was, he, from
time to time, addressed to her incoherently,
all the endearing expressions he had habitually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
used towards her in her childhood, calling her,
in low breathings that no other ear could hear,
his own beloved one, his own darling Julia,
his own precious one, thus as it were enforcing
each entreaty to her, to check the excessive
trembling to which she had given way, and
which, as it seemed rather to increase than
diminish, alarmed him so much, that the arm
with which it was necessary to support her,
drew her, as each verbal persuasion to still
her tremor failed, closer to the bosom in which
she herself seemed to seek a shelter; while she,
unknowing what she did, pressed his hand
with both of hers to her heart, still beating
tumultuously from the horrors of the scarcely
past scene, and her sobs, for the few seconds it
still took to reach the ship, continued audible
and convulsive.</p>

<p>A scene of so much emotion was, fortunately,
shrouded by the total darkness that prevailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin carried her himself up the side
of the Euphrasia, and to the cabin of Lady
Oswald; where, with the assistance of that
lady and her maid, he laid her on a sofa, still
wrapped in the already mentioned boat-cloak.</p>

<p>The consciousness of light and witnesses
calmed in some degree her agitation, or at
least checked those demonstrations of it into
which she had hitherto been betrayed. She
became passive, and lay, for a time, motionless
and silent, with her eyes closed. Fitz-Ullin
knelt beside her, and watched her countenance
with an expression of the most serious solicitude.
Lady Oswald, after the first stare of
amazement, offered every kind attention in
assiduous silence; only from time to time
looking the wonder which would have been
expressed on any occasion less surprising: so
that our heroine was received, to all appearance,
with as much composure as though she
had been expected. She shewed tokens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
life, only by gently waving from her every
offered restorative. She wished for stillness;
she wished to yield to a consolatory feeling
which had already, notwithstanding all the
horrors she had so lately both witnessed and
escaped, stolen over her heart; for who can,
under any circumstances, receive proofs of
affection from those they love, and not experience
consolation? She felt that she was still
dear to Fitz-Ullin; and though, apparently,
scarcely alive, became capable of a train of
reasoning on the subject. Her friendship,
then, was not, as she had feared, valueless in
his eyes! The brother-like affection he had
always had for her was regaining its ascendancy.
As a sister, she should once more
become the first object of his tenderness, the
source of his happiness, and she would be
happy—yet she sighed. Lady Oswald seized
the opportunity of entreating her to take some
restorative. She was obliged to open her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
eyes, obliged to raise herself, and in so doing,
to withdraw the hand Fitz-Ullin had till then
retained. He stood up, assisted Lady Oswald,
and spoke to her ladyship, which he had not
done before. The spell was broken! Julia
spoke too; she thanked Lady Oswald languidly.
She had no leisure to be surprised in
her turn, at seeing her ladyship where she was.
She tried to express to our hero her gratitude
for her preservation. He begged she would
not speak of his merely accidental service;
requesting her to remember, that he could not
be aware to whom he was rendering his assistance,
whether welcome or unwelcome.</p>

<p>“Unwelcome!” she repeated. He had
spoken with unnecessary strength of emphasis.
Even Lady Oswald looked surprised.</p>

<p>A short silence followed; when Julia, again
raising herself, began to express uneasiness about
the fears and anxiety of her friends at Lodore;
giving at the same time a hurried and incoherent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
account of how she had been carried
away from thence. Lady Oswald naturally
expressed her wonder, as to who could have
been the author of so daring an outrage.</p>

<p>Julia, looking down, said, she herself was at
a loss whom to suspect. She would have
added, that the only person to whom she could
have attributed such an outrage, she had not
once seen, or heard of, during the whole
transaction; and that, therefore, it was that
she was at a loss. But a natural feeling of
modesty made her hesitate and blush. Fitz-Ullin
viewed her with a searching look, which
gave her uneasiness, though she could not
comprehend its meaning. There was severity
in his eye when he first fixed it upon
her; yet, there was pity ere he removed
it. During her whole recital, the gloom of
his brow had deepened every moment; yet he
did not express the deep resentment that might
have been expected against the perpetrators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of such a violence. At one time, after a long
reverie, he made a very irrelevant remark:
observing, that Mr. St. Aubin had been to
blame, in not joining before the Euphrasia
sailed; for that his being too late, could not
have been accidental.</p>

<div class="verse">“Nay, frown not thus on me.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> breakfast Fitz-Ullin joined the ladies. The
gravity of his countenance and solemnity of his
manner were almost austere.</p>

<p>During breakfast he silently placed whatever
seemed desirable near Julia, but scarcely spoke,
except to answer Lady Oswald’s questions.</p>

<p>After breakfast he said, with some formality,
that he was extremely sorry the rules of the
service would not admit of his altering his
course on private business; as this placed it
out of his power to offer to land Lady Julia L.,
he therefore feared, he added, that her Ladyship
would be under the necessity of proceeding
to Leith. How unlike the whispers of last
night!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>He next spoke of the fortunate chance of
Lady Oswald’s being in the ship; and finally
it was arranged, that Julia should remain in
Edinburgh with Lady Oswald, till Lord L.
should be apprised of her being there, and
come for her. Fitz-Ullin now left them.</p>

<p>“My dear Lady Julia L.,” said Lady
Oswald, “I am going to ask a very extraordinary
question; but do tell me candidly, have
you rejected the addresses of Fitz-Ullin?” Julia
looked at her ladyship with unfeigned astonishment.
“Because,” continued Lady Oswald,
“his manner is so much that of a refused lover,
too proud to urge his suit, yet unable to conquer
his attachment; and, if such be the case,
I would so ardently, so anxiously, plead his
cause. I would enumerate his virtues; nay, I
would expose my own and my son’s necessities
to prove the nobleness of his heart, and to
obtain, if possible, happiness for one so willing
to impart the precious gift to others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“The happiness of him of whom you speak,
Lady Oswald,” replied Julia, suppressing a
sigh, “is not in my hands.” Then recovering
herself, she added, with forced firmness, “From
our childhood we have regarded each other as
brother and sister, and this habit may still
tincture our manners with a something which,
to those unacquainted with, or not recollecting
the peculiar circumstances may seem—may
appear—particular. But, as a lover, Lord
Fitz-Ullin has never addressed me.”</p>

<p>“Then most assuredly he will!” said Lady
Oswald. Julia blushed and smiled; the very
sound of the words was welcome to her, while
reason was compelled to reject their meaning.
“You have, you say,” continued Lady Oswald,
“the affection of a sister for Fitz-Ullin. If you
entertain a tenderer sentiment for any other
being, I have no right to inquire further; but
if you do not, my dear Lady Julia, make me
happy by saying so!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pray then be quite happy,” said Julia,
affecting to laugh; “and now let us recur no
more to this foolish subject.”</p>

<p>Lady Oswald fell into a reverie. She was
inclined to think, notwithstanding the altered
manners of the one, and the contradictory
assertions of the other, that a mutual attachment
did subsist between them; though at
present interrupted by some misunderstanding;
and having arrived at this conclusion, she resolved,
if possible, to become instrumental to
their happiness by bringing about an explanation.
A message at this moment very opportunely
came from Fitz-Ullin, to say that the day
was tolerably fine, and to beg to know if the ladies
would take a walk on deck. They consented;
and our hero came for them, bringing with him
a young lieutenant, by name Lord Surrel, and
son to the Duke of ⸺. Fitz-Ullin offered
his arm to Lady Oswald, leaving the care of
our heroine to Surrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia was absent and silent, and not even
conscious of the animated and delighted admiration
with which she as instantly as unintentionally
inspired her companion. At length
the conversation took a turn, which drew
something more of her attention.</p>

<p>“How much Fitz-Ullin feels the loss of his
friend, Captain Ormond,” observed Surrel,
struck by the seriousness of our hero’s countenance
as they passed and repassed him and
Lady Oswald.</p>

<p>“The circumstances were, I understand,
very melancholy and very remarkable,” faltered
out Julia, in reply.</p>

<p>“Very much so, indeed!” rejoined Surrel.
“You have heard all the particulars, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“From no better authority than the newspapers,”
she answered. “It was not possible
to enter on so painful a subject with Lord
Fitz-Ullin. Even Lady Oswald tells me she has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
not yet ventured to speak to him of his unfortunate
friend.”</p>

<p>“It was certainly the loss of his sister which
first unsettled the mind of Captain Ormond,”
said Surrel. “Circumstanced as they were,
there was something very dreadful in her
death; it was so evidently occasioned by that
unfortunate attachment, which had, I fancy,
become uncontrollable, before they were made
aware of their near relationship.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ormond’s illness,” observed Julia,
“Lady Oswald tells me, was decline, brought
on by a broken heart. Did you know Captain
Ormond?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well indeed!” replied Surrel; “I
was his first lieutenant during all the extraordinary
circumstances which preceded his
death. You are aware that he died quite
mad, poor fellow?”</p>

<p>“So the papers said,” she replied.</p>

<p>“When he first heard of the death of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
sister,” continued Surrel, we were laying off
the coast of *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*; I was standing with him
on the quarter-deck the morning he received the
letter, which, we suppose, brought the intelligence.
He did not open it, however, at the
time, but ordered his boat and went ashore,
where, after commanding the crew to wait for
him on the beach, he wandered up the country
among the woods, and was not heard of for
several days. At length, when we were beginning
to fear that some fatal accident must
have befallen him, he came one morning on
board in a shore-boat, and without noticing his
prolonged absence, gave some common orders.
For a time there was no visible change, except
a more settled gloom of manner. Gradually,
however, his looks assumed an alarming wildness,
his orders became inconsistent and arbitrary,
and from having been the mildest and
a most indulgent of commanders, he became quite
tyrant. On one occasion when I ventured to remonstrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in favour of a poor fellow whom,
without the slightest reason, he had ordered
to be flogged, he commanded the marines to
fire on me, saying, that he would give me,
while he walked the deck three times, to prepare
myself. Fortunately, before he had twice
walked the deck, he totally forgot the whole
business, sat down on one of the cannonade
slides, wrung his hands, and wept like a child!
We all stole away unperceived. While we
were at dinner, however, one of the youngsters
ran down and told us that the captain was
walking the deck, carrying a hanger in his
hand, and looking very furious. While we were
hesitating about what was best to be done, we
heard a tremendous noise in the captain’s cabin,
and hastening thither, found poor Ormond with
scarcely any covering, and in the very act of
flinging himself from the open window, from
which he had just thrown both the clothes he
had had on, and all else which was moveable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
We were now obliged to use force. The resistance
he made, poor fellow, was terrible.
He was carried on shore, where, in a few days,
he died raging mad!</p>

<p>“Only think,” he added, “of the Admiral
at *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, having me tried by a court martial
for what he termed my insubordination; but
he was a man incapable, in fact, from long
habit, of comprehending the simplest elements
of natural justice, and who could form no idea
of any rule of right, distinct from the rules of
the service. So, I was to allow a man who was
mad, to flog an innocent man to death, shoot
me, and fling himself out of the cabin window,
merely because he was my superior officer!”</p>

<p>Lady Oswald, meanwhile, intent on the
execution of her kindly project, made some
comments to her companion on his sadness,
with pauses between, hoping that he would
volunteer in making her his confidant (for they
walked quite apart from Julia and Surrel).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
But Fitz-Ullin only feared she must find it
cold, or made some irrelevant remark; in short,
did not take her ladyship’s hints. She
determined, therefore, to put the question in
a direct form; and as a preparatory remark,
said, “I can see, Fitz-Ullin, that you are
seriously attached to Lady Julia L.”</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin reddened to the very brows; but
did not seem to have any answer composed;
for he remained silent, and her Ladyship continued:
“You have some delicacy, some prejudice,
some secret reason, which prevents
your urging your own wishes. Let me know
all, place the business in my hands; and,
I think, I shall be able to make you both (with
a smile, and a peculiar emphasis on the word
‘both’) happier than you are at present.”</p>

<p>“Lady Oswald,” replied Fitz-Ullin solemnly,
and at the same time colouring still more
deeply, “whatever my feelings are, or rather,
have been, I neither intend to seek, nor wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to obtain, Lady Julia L.’s acceptance of my
hand.”</p>

<p>“Nor wish to obtain!” repeated Lady
Oswald.</p>

<p>“As a mark, therefore,” continued Fitz-Ullin,
“of your kind regard for me, I
must request that you will never again recur to
this subject.”</p>

<p>“But why, my dear Fitz-Ullin, why not
accept at least the assistance of my judgment
ere you condemn yourself to any uneasiness
of mind; for, happy you certainly are
not.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said Fitz-Ullin, “I cannot!
I must not! I have no right!”</p>

<p>“I certainly have no right to be officious,”
said Lady Oswald; “but I do confess, I wish
to see you happy, and I do think you would
not be refused.” He smiled bitterly. “But
if you really do not wish to be accepted—why—I
have done,” continued her Ladyship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>He quickened his pace: then slackened it;
then, discovering that it was quite too cold for
the ladies, abruptly put an end to the walk.</p>

<p>Lady Oswald, after this conversation,
thought it a necessary point of delicacy, when
in company with Julia, to recur no more to the
subject of her nephew.</p>

<p>This morning the Euphrasia fell in with
a small trader, which, though bound for a port
they had left behind, and having no accommodation
suited for ladies, could carry a letter
that, by being put into the post that evening,
would probably reach Lord L. some time
before the arrival of the Euphrasia at Leith,
and perhaps enable him to meet his daughter
there. At any rate, it would shorten his own
period of anxiety. Such a letter was accordingly
written and dispatched. Its contents
were calculated to astonish his Lordship not
a little. It spoke of Julia’s deliverance by
Fitz-Ullin in terms of the warmest gratitude;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and naturally expressed her unfeigned wonder,
as to who could have committed the outrage
of attempting to tear her from her home;
adding, that the only person whom circumstances
could justify her in suspecting, she had
not even seen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent9">“Oh! north wind cease,</div>
<div class="verse">And let me listen for his coming tread.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Young</span> Surrel became hourly more assiduous,
and either wanted modesty to perceive that his
attentions were unwelcome, or delicacy to
withdraw them on that account.</p>

<p>The annoyance to Julia was really growing
serious; when, one morning after breakfast,
Fitz-Ullin placed himself near our heroine, a
thing not now usual with him. While in this
situation, he took an opportunity of saying to
her, in an under tone, “Will you grant me a
few moments’ conversation with you alone?”
His late cold and constrained behaviour had
made such a request so unexpected, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
instead of colouring, she became quite pale,
looked up a moment, and again hastily withdrew
her eyes without reply.</p>

<p>“Do not mistake me,” he added, with rather
a haughty air, “but, I shall just take Lady
Oswald on deck, and having left her walking
with Arthur, return and explain myself immediately.”</p>

<p>The proposition to walk was then made
aloud. Lady Oswald had no objection, and
asked Julia, as a matter of course, to accompany
them. Our heroine declined; this was
certainly consenting to the interview, Julia felt
that it was, and coloured while she made her
excuse.</p>

<p>Lady Oswald and Fitz-Ullin left the cabin.
Julia neither moved nor breathed, till their receding
steps were lost in the confused tramping,
which was always going on over head.</p>

<p>She then drew a very long breath, and began
to prepare herself. “He will return immediately!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
she thought. She tried to compose
her spirits, but in vain: her heart fluttered like
a bird trying to escape from its cage. The
tramping over head increased; she turned pale.
It lessened; the colour stole gradually over her
cheeks again. She listened, and breathing was
again suspended, and every power of life concentrated
in the sense of hearing. This became
so acute, that, amid all the mingled sounds
of a busy deck, she could yet plainly distinguish
the well known tread of Fitz-Ullin on the
main deck, approaching the cabin door. A cold
sensation passed over her cheeks and brow.
She clasped her hands together a moment, then
let one fall at her side, and rested the other on
the table. But there, its trembling movement
was so visible, that with hasty confusion she
withdrew it; and, fixing her eyes on the
ground, held down, with a fatiguing effort,
the universal tremor of her frame. He entered.
He stood before her. He seated himself beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
her. But, he made no attempt to take her
hand.</p>

<p>One universal glow had covered her face and
neck at his first approach, while she could have
cried with vexation at the exposure. “You do
not misunderstand me, I hope,” he said, perceiving
her pitiable agitation. “You must, I
think,” he continued, “be able to comprehend
for what purpose I have requested this interview.
You must have expected that I could
not see Lord Surrel’s importunate attentions,
and remain passive.”</p>

<p>She made no reply; but coloured, if possible,
deeper than before, and looked more studiously
downward; yet, Fitz-Ullin perceived the dawning
of a pleasurable feeling shining through
the confusion that covered as with a veil every
other expression of her countenance. How
can he be so foolish, thought Julia, as to be
jealous of an absolute stranger, like Lord
Surrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am rejoiced to perceive,” he recommenced,
“that instead of being offended at my
presumption, you are good enough to seem
disposed to give me a favourable hearing. It
was quite impossible for me not to be fully
aware—not to know, in fact, what are, what
must be your feelings, yet,”—he paused. So
audacious, so well assured a suitor, one who
was thus certain, that her preference for himself
must render the attentions of any one else
importunate, did not seem to need encouragement;
and Julia, though the tears of shame
started to her eyes, was too gentle, too fondly
attached to chide; she therefore remained silent;
and, (must it be confessed?) uncontrollable
delight predominated very unduly over
the indignation she thought she ought to feel!</p>

<p>“At least, I should suppose I am right?” he
continued, in a questioning tone. “If so—if,”
Julia at length seemed to consider some little
manifestation of spirit necessary. “Most people,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
she faltered out, “would be offended at
having their sentiments thus taken for granted;
but you think, I suppose, that our long intimacy
authorizes you to act as you please.”</p>

<p>“As I please!” repeated Fitz-Ullin, “most
assuredly not as I please, but as you please.
It may be, and certainly is in my power, and
indeed I feel myself called upon, while you are
in this ship, not to permit Lord Surrel, or any
officer of mine, to make his attentions troublesome
to you, in a situation where you can neither
avoid his society, nor enjoy the protection
of your natural friends; but, to control the
inclinations of Lady Julia L⸺,” he added,
(and with some bitterness) “is an undertaking
to which I have not the boldness to aspire!”</p>

<p>Fortunately for Julia the stunning effects of
the new and heart-chilling conviction supplied
by this last speech, was so overpowering, that
it gave her somewhat the appearance of outward
calm. So, it was Lord Surrel’s attentions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Lord Surrel’s love, simply as troublesome to
her, not as interfering with his own, of which he
was speaking! Here, indeed, was a revulsion
of every feeling, too tremendous for Julia’s
strength! Her heart utterly ceased beating,
her cheeks became as white and cold as marble.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand then,” said Fitz-Ullin,
surprised at her silence and change of
countenance, “that the attentions of Lord
Surrel are agreeable to you?”</p>

<p>Starting into momentary life, she exclaimed,
hastily and eagerly, “Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Then I know how to act,” said Fitz-Ullin,
as rising, and bowing with a dignified and rather
scornful air, he seemed about to leave the
cabin; when, pausing and returning a step or
two, he stopped before her, and added, in a
suppressed tone, and with visible effort, “I
was for a moment apprehensive that my present
interference was, perhaps, as unwelcome
as my unconscious intermeddling on another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
occasion. But, in that particular at least, I
trust you do me justice. I acted according to
the routine of duty. It was impossible for me
to know—to suppose—that some such step
indeed was contemplated, I was partly aware;
but of the when, and the how, you must be
conscious I could have no suspicion. You
acquit me then, I trust, of availing myself of a
reposed confidence to play the ruffian, and
using the power entrusted to me for the public
good, for private and unjustifiable purposes?”</p>

<p>Julia was unable to attach any meaning to
his words: indeed she was too miserable to
care what they meant. She therefore remained
with her eyes fixed on the floor without
attempting to reply. “You are silent,” he
recommenced; “I am conscious that I have
now entered on an interdicted subject; but,
though I may have transgressed the letter, I
trust I have not the spirit of the interdict.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
She opened her lips, but, without the power to
articulate, closed them again.</p>

<p>“The subject, I see, is painful to you,” he
persisted, “but only say that, in this particular,
you do me justice!”</p>

<p>Julia, still unable to comprehend his meaning,
and still, as we have said, almost indifferent
to it, yet willing to comply with any
thing in the shape of a request from Fitz-Ullin,
summoned all her powers to her aid,
and whispered, “Yes,” but without venturing
to look up. Fitz-Ullin stood gazing upon her
for some moments, then sighed audibly, and
quitted her without again speaking.</p>

<p>Julia, by the time she thought him quite
gone, stole one alarmed look all round, as if
to ascertain that she was really alone, then
darted into the inner cabin, locked the door on
herself, and remained there the rest of the day,
pleading, on being summoned to dinner, a
headach. When she did appear the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
morning her headach did not seem much abated.
Lady Oswald, who met her with a meaning,
and almost a triumphant smile, looked
surprised and disappointed, and, after examining
our heroine’s countenance for a short time,
determined not to introduce a subject, of which
her heart had been full all night. Surrel’s
attentions were no longer troublesome.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Winds drive along the clouds: on wings of fire,</div>
<div class="verse">The lightnings fly!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late one hazy afternoon, when the
Euphrasia made the land near the entrance of
the Frith of Forth. As it did not appear
possible to get to Leith that evening, Fitz-Ullin
proposed to the pilots to lay-to till
morning. They declared, however, that they
could take the ship in by night as well as by
day, the lights being sufficient to guide them.
Accordingly, they stood in for port; about
an hour after, when they supposed themselves
still some miles from land, it was announced
from the forecastle that there was a ship at
anchor ahead. Almost immediately afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
however, it was discovered that the object they
were approaching was a huge rock. In the
greatest confusion the ship was now tacked
about, but hardly were her sails turned, when
it was found that she was getting into shoal
water, and at the same moment land appeared
just under her lee. Fitz-Ullin now fearing
that the pilots were quite unfit for their duty,
gave immediate orders to let go the anchor.
During the short time thus occupied, there
was scarcely a breath drawn, all, each moment
expecting that the ship would strike. The
anchor dropt, the sails were furled, and the
clouds, breaking a little, there was just starlight
sufficient to enable Fitz-Ullin to ascertain
that they lay between the Bass rock and
Tantallon castle, in a little steep-sided bay,
the mouth of which, except at one small outlet,
was closed by a very dangerous looking
reef. He sent a boat with the master and
another officer to sound, on which it was discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
that the ship was actually anchored
on a ledge of rocks; yet was it judged advisable,
as there was very little wind, not to
attempt quitting this perilous situation before
morning; for, the clouds having closed again
thicker than ever, the darkness had become
quite impenetrable.</p>

<p>Our hero remained on deck, giving every
precautionary and preparatory order, till the
night was far advanced; when, much fatigued,
and finding that nothing more could be done
till daylight, he went below, and lay down on
a sofa for a short time, leaving directions with
the officer of the watch to call him half an hour
before dawn. All was soon perfectly still:
every one seemed to have forgotten, in “nature’s
sweet restorer, balmy sleep,” both the
dangers they had so lately passed, and those
which still threatened them.</p>

<p>After some little time spent in uneasy reflections,
a sort of stupor, occasioned by excessive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
fatigue both of mind and body, stole
over the senses of Fitz-Ullin. His slumbers
were at first much broken; but, at length,
after telling himself for the hundredth time that
nothing could be done till daylight, they assumed
somewhat more the character of repose.
He had not enjoyed such quite an hour when a
low murmuring sound arose, at first apparently
at an immense distance, as though the lulled
winds were awaking and whispering together
at the furthest extremity of space: a gloomy
imagination could fancy them secretly conspiring,
at this dead hour of the night, the
destruction of those who thus unconsciously
slept. The sound grew louder.</p>

<p>It approached—it became a howl—it drew
nearer and nearer still. At length the ominous
blast, sweeping through the rigging of the
vessel, shrieked wildly, and passed away. Fitz-Ullin
sat upright for a moment: but the demon
of the storm had sounded his signal cry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and was hushed! A pause of breathless silence
followed. Our hero listened for some seconds,
and finding all still, concluded that some startling
dream must have awakened him, and
yielded again to repose. The distant murmur
recommenced, increased, and grew by gusts
impetuous; the howling blast drew near again,
but instead of retiring as before, was pursued
by another, and yet another, as it were urging
each other forward, till their united and accumulated
roar became, in an incredibly short
time, tremendous.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin dreamed of a tempest; but for a
few troubled moments, did not again awake;
when, suddenly opening his eyes, he leaped
up, and, bewildered by the universal uproar
which now reigned, without waiting to collect
his scattered thoughts, hastened on deck.</p>

<p>It was by this time blowing a gale, the ship
beginning to labour excessively, and the darkness
so impenetrable, that while his sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
hearing was thus assailed on every side, his
sight was strained in vain to discover any
object around him, and he was made sensible
of being on the upper deck only by the buffeting
of the winds, and still rougher salutation
of a heavy sea, which, as it passed over the
ship, threatened to carry him with it; yet
nothing could be done or attempted till day
dawned. He remained on deck however. It
was the longest hour he had ever passed.
From time to time he cast impatient glances
towards the east, which looked, he thought, if
possible, blacker than the rest of the horizon!
At length the sky in that quarter assumed a
greyish cast, and gradually it became evident
that objects might have been in some
degree discernible, but for the thickness of
the haze which covered every thing, causing a
cruel prolongation of suspense. In a little
time, however, one yellow streak appeared near
the horizon; then the clouds broke in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
direction, and seemed tumbling and boiling
round the spot; then, plunging among them,
the rising sun was seen at last, for one moment
only; it resembled a ball of fire; it seemed to
roll past the opening; it disappeared again,
and the dense masses of cloud closed immediately.
There was now a visible increase of
light. A rush of the tempest swept a part of
the mist away, while the rocks, looking black
and gigantic through what remained, appeared
quite close to the ship, as she rode at single
anchor.</p>

<p>The waves, notwithstanding the confined area
of the little bay, rose with a tremendous swell;
though so far unlike the alternate mountain and
valley of the open ocean, that the whole body
of water which the basin contained, seemed to
swing at once to and fro with a simultaneous
movement, which every time threatened to
dash the frigate against the perpendicular sides
of the cliff. At another moment, would the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
hurricane seize, as it were, the helpless vessel
in its stupendous grasp, and appear about to
lift her from the water. She seemed, in short,
the sole object of contention to the warring element;
while they, in their fury, appeared resolved
to tear her in a thousand pieces and part
her among them, rather than give up the struggle.
Fitz-Ullin saw that any effort to get out
of this dangerous bay or creek, must, at present,
prove impossible, as the wind blew directly in;
and it was quite evident that the reef must
bring them up, before sufficient canvas could
be set, to give the ship headway. He summoned
however the officers and crew around
him, to afford them the usual privilege of giving
their opinion in a case of so much emergency.
Some were for cutting away the masts and
making the boats ready; but this would be forsaking
the post of duty too soon. Some recommended
attempting to get under way; but
this, as had been shown, with the wind right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
ahead, would have been madness. Fitz-Ullin
therefore rejected each of those suggestions, and
finally decided on clinging, as long as the cable
held, to the only rational hope which remained,
that of the wind chancing to abate, or shift a
little in their favour before any fatal catastrophe
should take place.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fears of both ladies had, on the evening
before, been allayed as much as possible. The
peculiarly hazardous situation of the vessel was
of course not explained to them.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, though they heard the raving
of the tempest, and could not avoid being
alarmed, they were by no means aware of the
full extent of the danger; and even fancied,
(as in such cases women and children always
do,) that so near land they must be comparatively
safe.</p>

<p>Lady Oswald was in the inner cabin; Julia
in the outer one; when, to her utter astonishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Fitz-Ullin entered, and with a countenance
of the deepest seriousness, without hesitation
or apology, approached and clasped her
to his breast. He looked at her mournfully;
he kissed her forehead. “Julia,” he said,
“when I have done what I can for the ship, I
will return to you.” He again pressed his lips
on her fair brow; but now it was with a wild
fervour, differing widely from the tender solemnity
which had at first characterized his
manner.</p>

<p>Lady Oswald entered. He had just time to
release the passive Julia, the excess of whose
surprise had so entirely suspended every faculty,
that she had not even blushed. She did so
now, to an excess that was overwhelming.</p>

<p>He grasped his aunt’s hand hastily as he
hurried past her and disappeared. At the same
moment, Arthur running in and throwing himself
into his mother’s arms, told her, that they
must all be lost.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The winds came rustling from their hills.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the gunroom, meantime, some of the officers
were eating their breakfast with as much composure
as if there was nothing the matter.
Others there were, it must be confessed, who
sipped their coffee slowly and gloomily enough;
while others again, with a strange mixture of
caution and carelessness, were packing up their
valuables, and calling aloud the while to the
steward, to keep their breakfast hot. A cold
one would scarcely have been remembered on
such an occasion, by a landsman.</p>

<p>One of the most affecting features of the hour
was presented by the helpless prisoners at the
hatchways, who, in profound silence, manifested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
their anxious feeling, by crowding to the bars
which fastened them down, to gain, if possible,
some intelligence of what was going on; while,
at every roll of the ship, they expected to go
to the bottom. On the coast, on the Tantallon
side, the friendly Scots had collected to the
number of thousands; bringing down boats,
rafts, ropes, &amp;c. to the part of the beach on
which it was generally expected the ship must
be wrecked.</p>

<p>On the quarter-deck Fitz-Ullin walked alone,
occasionally going forward to look at the cable,
which, being strained to the utmost, was every
moment in danger of parting; an accident
which, should it occur, must be followed by
instant destruction.</p>

<p>From the cable he raised his eyes from time
to time to the vane, and withdrew them again
in bitter disappointment, for the wind was still
right ahead.</p>

<p>All things remained in this state of fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
suspense, till nearly twelve at noon; when our
hero, whose eyes were, at the moment, anxiously
raised to the vane, saw it veer round one
point in his favour. Even this slight advantage
was not to be neglected for a moment: it
warranted an attempt to quit a situation of so
much peril.</p>

<p>A spring was instantly placed on the cable,
which brought the ship’s broadside more to the
wind; the three topsails, double reefed, were
set, and the carpenter, having been previously
placed ready with an uplifted axe, a single
blow (such was now the tension) parted the
cable, and the courses being at the same moment
added, the vessel, which had been straining
for way, flew through the water almost on
her beam ends. While she thus rushed towards
the dangerous barrier, perfect silence was
observed by every one. It was generally apprehended
that she must split her canvas, or
carry away her masts; yet it was necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
put her under this heavy press of sail, to overbalance,
if possible, the great lee-way she had,
and so get her clear of the rocks. She now
approached them with incredible velocity, passed
them at but a few yards distance, and,
shipping two or three heavy seas, weathered
the reef in safety. A general shout of joy
burst at the moment from the hitherto breathless
crowd on the deck, and was as instantly
answered by an echoing shout from the prisoners
throughout the hold.</p>

<p>Some minutes, at least, must elapse, ere
Fitz-Ullin could be justified in leaving the
deck; he dispatched Arthur therefore to his
aunt and Julia, with the joyful tidings, and, as
soon as possible, followed him.</p>

<p>On entering the cabin, where both ladies
now were, our hero’s countenance was covered
with the glow of successful exertion. It was
animated, it was even joyful! He pressed
Lady Oswald’s eagerly offered hands in silence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and passed to Julia. He raised one of hers
and paused, as if to take breath, which he had
not yet given himself time to do.</p>

<p>He looked in silence at her changing colour
and downcast eyes, and during the moments
so employed, his own expression became entirely
altered. Speaking with effort, and, for
the occasion, with unnatural coldness, he said,
“Arthur has of course informed you that the
danger is over: it is only left for me, therefore,
to apologize for the rashness of which I was
guilty, in giving you unnecessary alarm. And,”
he added, in a lowered and somewhat faltering
tone, at the same time glancing at Lady Oswald,
and seeing that she was engaged by her
son, “and for the expression of—in short,
feelings which—which had been better unexpressed!
The certainty, almost, of approaching
death to both, and the brotherly affection
I have from childhood been permitted to cherish,
are all I can plead in my excuse.” Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
waiting for reply, he turned to Lady
Oswald, and again hastily taking her hand,
murmured something about his duties on deck,
and left the cabin. Arthur followed him; and
Lady Oswald’s spirits being quite exhausted,
she retired to the inner cabin to lie down.</p>

<p>Julia was left alone. The terror and the joy
also seemed over. It was all like a dream:
she felt bewildered; she was unhappy too!
more unhappy than she had been when each
moment she expected the ship would go to
pieces! She could not conceal this feeling
from herself, nor that it had its source in the
unaccountable alternations of Fitz-Ullin’s manner.
Yet she was indignant at her own weakness!
She sat for a long time motionless: a
blush at length appeared on her cheek, for now
fancy was pourtraying, and memory acknowledging,
the scene which had taken place during
the moment of extreme danger! How had she
permitted, passively permitted, conduct so unwarrantable—so
incredible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> the meditations of our heroine were
broken off by the sudden entrance of her father
accompanied by Fitz-Ullin. The Euphrasia was
by this time safely anchored in Leith roads.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ embraced his child; both were
some moments silent; Julia’s weariness of
heart found an inexpressible solace in a passion
of tears, shed on the bosom of a kind
parent. She tried to persuade herself that
they were all tears of joy.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ had received Julia’s letter. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
contents were not easily reconciled with those
of the three notes left on her table at Lodore;
but Lord L⸺ determined to reserve the
expression of any feeling of doubt he might
yet entertain, for the subject of a strictly
private interview; and, never to allow the
world, but particularly Fitz-Ullin, to suppose
that he could, for a moment, suspect his
daughter of having quitted her home willingly.
“I have indeed spent,” said Lord
L⸺, in answer to a remark of Julia’s on
his looking fatigued, “an anxious night and
a truly terrible morning. I arrived in Leith
just in time to witness the distress of the
Euphrasia, on board of which, by your letter,
I knew you to be. I was among those, Julia,
who crowded the beach during the many hours
of awful suspense, while the vessel was, each
moment, expected to drive on the rocks! but
now,” he added, “that things have ended so
happily, a little rest will remedy all that. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
your preserver, my child, how shall I sufficiently
thank him!” Fitz-Ullin, who, from
delicacy, had left the cabin for a short time,
had just returned, and now stood a little
apart. Lord L⸺, as he spoke, looked from
him to Julia, and from Julia to him, as though
he would have added, “shall I reward him
with the gift of the precious treasure he has
preserved?”</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin seemed to comprehend the look,
for his eyes sought the ground, and he coloured
slightly. Julia too blushed. Fitz-Ullin however
continued silent. Lord L⸺ paused a
scarcely perceptible moment, then, assuming
an air of dignity, which almost amounted to
haughtiness, asked Julia if she felt sufficiently
recovered to go on shore immediately? “We
shall take an early opportunity,” he added,
turning to our hero, “of expressing, at more
length, our grateful acknowledgments to Lord
Fitz-Ullin.” Both gentlemen endeavoured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
conceal their feelings by bowing very profoundly,
and Julia, promising to get ready
for her departure in a few moments, joined
Lady Oswald in the inner cabin. Lord L⸺
could not have been so unreasonable as to have
expected that, if Fitz-Ullin did intend to propose
for his daughter, he was to do so in such
a moment of hurry as the present; but, there
had been an undefinable something in the
look and manner of our hero, which conveyed
to the haughty Earl a sense, that the honour
of his alliance had been tacitly declined; and,
still worse, he felt an inward conviction that
his secret wishes, in a moment of emotion, of
which he was now ashamed, had been in some
degree understood.</p>

<p>While the ladies’ preparations were being
made, Henry came on board. After setting
out for Plymouth, he had seen, by a paper he
had taken up at an inn, that the Euphrasia had
sailed for Leith, and he had in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
turned back to join her there. What must
have been his astonishment, just as he set
foot on the deck, to behold rise to view, coming
up from the cabin, his cousin Julia, handed up
by Fitz-Ullin! He received a glance from
Lord L⸺ which was not at all calculated to
set him at his ease. His lordship, however,
gave at this time, no other expression to his
feelings. Henry soon became reassured; paid
his compliments to Lady Oswald; and finally
asked and obtained permission of our hero, to
attend the ladies in landing.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺, taking Fitz-Ullin by the arm,
walked apart with him a few paces, then said:
“After this day, your lordship will oblige me,
by not permitting Mr. St. Aubin to land again
while we are in Edinburgh; to him I must
ascribe this daring attempt to tear my daughter
from her home, and compel her to form a union
as repugnant to her own feelings, as ineligible
in my eyes.” Here a pause took place; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Fitz-Ullin, though he listened with polite attention,
did not reply. “As, however, my
daughter does not return his attachment, I can
have no scruple on the score of parental feeling,
in preventing all intercourse in future.”
When Lord L⸺ concluded, our hero bowed
his assent. Fitz-Ullin attended the party in
his own barge to the shore, but excused himself
from landing, pleading the necessity of
returning immediately to his ship.</p>

<p>On arriving on board, he gave orders to have
the pilots detained, having determined to give
them into the hands of the Port Admiral, to
suffer whatever punishment might be adjudged
them, for having undertaken a service for which
they were quite unfit. The order however was
too late, the pilots had already disappeared.
They had managed to get away unnoticed; it
was supposed in the shore-boat that brought
Lord L⸺ on board.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the time that, on board the Euphrasia,
Fitz-Ullin’s champagne was spreading hilarity
among his officers, to whom he gave an excellent
dinner in honour of their late escape, a
tall, large proportioned, elderly man, in a college
cap and gown, was pacing up and down by
the dim light of the lamps, in one of the then
best streets of Auld Reekie, immediately beneath
the windows of Lord L⸺’s hotel. He
cast from time to time impatient glances at the
door as he passed and repassed. At length it
opened and shewed the figure of a younger
man, habited in naval uniform, and in the act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of taking his cocked hat from a servant in the
lit up hall. The door closed again, and the
officer joined him of the cap and gown. “So,”
said Henry, for he was the officer, “the game
is up, I fear.”</p>

<p>“The devil it is,” replied the person addressed.</p>

<p>“Is it not?” said Henry.</p>

<p>“Throw again,” said the stranger. They
walked on for a time in silence. “Why certainly,”
said Henry, “however strong their
suspicions may be, they have no proofs that
would enable them to take any steps against
me; and as to my being forbid Lord L⸺’s
house, and my aunt’s, whenever Julia is there,
it can make very little difference, unless they
absolutely incarcerate her. We now have the
title-deeds, we have only to seize her person,
the first opportunity that offers, and I can still
compel her to retract all her declarations of
having been carried off against her will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish the devil would tempt her,” said
the stranger, “to take a moonlight view of
the Bass Rock.”</p>

<p>“I can see,” continued Henry, “by Fitz-Ullin’s
countenance that they have not come
to any explanation, nor are they likely to do
so; and her absurd infatuation about him will
keep her from marrying any one else, for some
time at least.”</p>

<p>“What, then, is Lord L⸺’s present belief?”
asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“Faith,” replied Henry, “I hardly know;
I believe he hardly knows himself. We had
quite a scene there, just now. His lordship
took me to task in rather strong terms, for my
supposed misdemeanours. I replied, however,
very coolly, that I should neither deny nor confess
any thing, but refer him to his daughter,
who must know whether she had eloped with
me or not. She, of course, declared she had
not. But she was evidently afraid of exasperating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
me, therefore said very little. Lord
L⸺ showed her the three notes found on
her table. She declared she had never written
them. ‘Am I then to believe these letters forgeries?’
said his lordship, and he looked towards
me. I met his eye with all the steadiness
I could command, but remained silent.
So, after a few more questions, for the answers
to which I persisted in referring him to Julia,
I was dismissed, having been, of course, forbid
the house.”</p>

<p>An expression of contempt was here muttered
by the stranger.</p>

<p>“But how did you know,” asked Henry,
“that the Euphrasia was going round to Leith,
and how did you gain admittance into the
ship?” “I learned her destination at Plymouth:
the admiral’s certificate settled the
rest,” replied the stranger. “The difficulty
was, to get in time to where the pilots for
Leith are taken on board.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who was the second pilot?” asked
Henry.</p>

<p>“Charpantier. I have always three or four
fellows, regular sworn port-pilots.”</p>

<p>“And did you really mean to run the ship
aground?” again asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Most certainly!” replied his companion,
in a tone indicating neither doubt nor compunction.
“Why,” he continued, “I could
have run her high and dry without danger to
our lives, when she must have gone to pieces;
and I had hands enough on the rock to do the
rest.”</p>

<p>“Men whom you could depend upon?” demanded
Henry.</p>

<p>“A more determined set of fellows never
hauled a boat up the Bass since the time of
good King James,” replied the stranger.
“And our men would not have been the last,”
he added with a sneer, “to have rendered their
timely assistance to the distressed crew of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Euphrasia; nor should Lady Julia L⸺ have
been the last of the passengers their praiseworthy
exertions would have rescued from a
watery grave.” Henry laughed.</p>

<p>“Fool!” uttered in no very persuasive tone,
was the courteous rejoinder of his companion,
who, now that he happened to turn while passing
a lamp, displayed the same fierce features
which we have seen bending over the title-deeds
of the Craigs, by the light of the colliery
lantern. “And, as for Fitz-Ullin,” he continued,
“if he did not know his way to the
bottom, he might have been shown it! Confound
him! If he had not given the order to
let go the anchor, in less than two minutes
no power could have saved the ship!”
Both personages now proceeded in silence
along the street, till their figures were lost in
the gloom of its further extremity. Not long
after the same two figures became visible on
the verge of the Salisbury Craigs, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
disappeared around the brow of the hill, a little
below Arthur’s Seat, leaving the calm serenity
of the scene unbroken by any living or moving
object; while the distant villages, the bare
hills, the waters of the Frith, the shipping in
the roads, the deserted palace and ruined chapel,
all slumbered silently in the clear moonshine
of a summer night. And the city itself, so
full of human life, where so many hearts and
so many pulses at the very moment beat, presented
an image as still and cold as though its
piles of building, reflecting partial lights, and
casting from their singularly irregular site gigantic
shadows, were but the steep sides of so
many masses of solid rock.</p>

<div class="verse">“Arise, tell him that came from the roaring</div>
<div class="verse">Of waters, that Innisfail gives his feast.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Fitz-Ullin called at Lord L⸺’s
hotel. His lordship was out; Lady Oswald and
Julia were in the drawing-room. Our hero’s
visit was short and formal; on his return on
board, he found a note from Lord L⸺, containing
an invitation to dinner, for that day.
He hesitated, but finally he decided on going.
His reception from Lord L⸺ and Lady Oswald,
was cordial; from Julia, embarrassed.
After some general conversation, Lord L⸺
drew our hero towards a window, and opened
the conference by speaking of the rescue of his
daughter. Fitz-Ullin, in his turn, expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
warmly the grateful affection due by him to
Lord L⸺ and his family. This gave nature
and heart to his manner.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ was more delighted with him
than ever; and while he so felt, unconsciously
looked towards Julia. He accounted, however,
for so doing, by again recurring to the subject
of her preservation from a fate of which he
himself, he said, knew not half the horror till
his last conversation with his daughter. And
his lordship here mentioned, in strong terms,
the repugnance evinced by Julia, to the addresses
of her cousin. In fact, it was to take an
opportunity of impressing this particular on his
auditor, that Lord L⸺ had drawn him aside.
Then after renewing with becoming seriousness,
his expressions of grateful obligation towards
our hero, his lordship added, with an air of pleasantry,
“Were I a monarch, Fitz-Ullin, I should
say: ask what thou wilt, even unto the half of
my kingdom, and I will give it thee!” Our hero,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
instead of smiling, as might have been expected,
turned deadly pale. This, however,
was unperceived by Lord L⸺, who, returning
towards the ladies arm in arm with Fitz-Ullin,
stopped, perhaps unconscious of the
association of ideas which had guided his
steps before Julia, and, taking her hand kindly,
said, “I don’t think, my child, you have
half thanked your preserver!” She replied
by looking up in the face, first of her father,
and then of Fitz-Ullin, with the gentlest and
sweetest expression possible. Yet, strange to
say, the immediate effect on our hero was
evidently painful. Dinner was announced at
the moment, and Lord L⸺, making over
the hand he still held to Fitz-Ullin, offered his
own arm to Lady Oswald, and led her towards
the dining-room. The arrangement was quite
a matter of course, yet both Julia and our hero
coloured.</p>

<p>When they had taken their places at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
table, Julia did not again venture to raise her
eyes, while the long fringes of the downcast
lids rested on cheeks from which a more than
usual glow had not yet subsided. She happened
to be seated beneath a peculiarly brilliant
lamp, and, consequently, in the very
midst of a shower of beams; so that the consciousness
of want of shelter for the blushes
already raised called up, each moment, new
ones. The blaze of light streaming thus on
her countenance, shining on each of all the
light and glossy ringlets, which floated in rich
profusion around her shoulders, (such was
then the fashion,) and reflected by the dazzling
whiteness of her neck and arms, rendered her
altogether so bright a vision that any one who
had sat in the dangerous vicinity might have
found their eyes attracted in that direction.
It was the voice of Lord L⸺ proposing
some interesting question respecting the choice
of soups, which seemed to remind Fitz-Ullin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
that his had been fixed on his fair neighbour
longer than good breeding would have authorised.
He had been picturing to himself, in
contrast with the present, that hour of darkness
and wild alarm, when that same profusion
of beautiful hair that it now seemed
dangerous but to look upon, had hung dishevelled
over his own arm; that Julia, now so
bashful, so reserved, had clung to his side as
though he were all that was dear to her on
earth!</p>

<p>Had such things been? And now was it,
indeed, the same being who sat beside him,
all brightness, all attraction, yet unapproachable?</p>

<p>During the evening, as there were no strangers
present, the late extraordinary event
formed the chief topic of conversation. Fitz-Ullin’s
manner, while the subject was being
discussed, puzzled Lord L⸺ extremely.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin was now speaking, and seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
with effort; his eyes the while fixed on the
arrangement his own fingers were making on
the tea-table, of the crumbs to which they had
reduced a small bit of cake, accepted probably
as unconsciously as now its pulverized particles
were formed into squares and circles.
“He either,” continued Lord L⸺ to himself,
“is more interested than, for some reason
or other, he chooses should be known, or
less so than, in common gratitude to the
family, and a natural feeling of regard towards
the companion of his childhood, he ought to
be!” What Lord L⸺ would have thought
of our hero cherishing a natural feeling of
regard for the companion of his childhood had
he continued the poor nameless Edmund, he
did not ask himself. The next morning Lord
L⸺ and his daughter left Edinburgh.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> shall pass over Julia’s reception at Lodore,
it was so exactly what might have been expected.</p>

<p>No one, of course, expressed, in the presence
of Mrs. Montgomery, their conviction of
Henry’s guilt. From the very strange account
which our heroine gave of her adventures, her
hearers were disposed to suspect that, in her
terror, she had mistaken a coal cellar for a
coal pit. This, however, she declared could
not be the case. But what traveller likes to
have the most marvellous of their adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
translated into mere, common place, vulgar
accidents.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson, however, was of opinion that,
making due allowance for the exaggerations
of a terrified fancy, Julia might be nearly
right; as no more effectual places of concealment
could be devised, than the situations
described by her; nor was there any class of
people, among whom an unprincipled person,
could more readily find agents suited to their
purpose, than the wretches in whose hands she
had unquestionably been. He thought it probable,
therefore, that something might be discovered
by questioning, if not directly, indirectly,
all sorts of persons connected with the
neighbouring works; some might have been
engaged in a service of the kind, whose absolute
ignorance would render them liable, on
being spoken with, to betray their employers
unconsciously.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Lord L⸺ and Mr. Jackson,
in pursuance of the plan of operations suggested
by the latter, set out, at a very early
hour, for Whitehaven.</p>

<p>When in the vicinity of the Gins, and in
sight of a clump of fir-trees which shade a part
of that road, their ears were saluted by loud,
coarse laughter, clanking of chains, and trampling
of horses.</p>

<p>In a few moments a troop of mounted colliers
began to make their appearance, emerging
from behind the trees. The gentlemen could
immediately perceive that the party was headed
by that far famed Amazon, called Jin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Gins. Her costume and whole appearance such
as have already been described. With a countenance
full of impudent glee, she was throwing
occasional looks and loud speeches behind
her, as, with perfect ease, she sat without
saddle, and guided with a bridle of rope, apparently
the same animal on which we have
already seen her. Her companions were, of
course, not better mounted. They, indeed,
chiefly rode in couples, a male and a female
on each beast, and, not unfrequently, seated
back to back, with all their four heels goading
the ribs of the but half-alive animal, to keep it
in motion.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ and Mr. Jackson were by this
time close to them, and his lordship, his countenance
expressive of much disgust, was just
beginning to guide his rein with a careful hand,
and measure his distances with a cautious eye,
for the purpose of passing through this sooty
train without soil, when the whole troop, closing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
round both gentlemen, and whirling their
hats in the air, gave a loud cheer, followed by
sudden silence and a simultaneous grin, which
shewed at one flash the teeth of the whole
party. The next moment, seeming to perceive
that they were not understood, numerous voices
uttered at once, “Some ’ot te drink—an ye
please.”</p>

<p>Lord L⸺, as soon as he could be got to
comprehend, complied with the request, and
was passing on, amid three cheers louder than
the former, when Mr. Jackson, addressing him
in an under tone, said he felt inclined to
have some conversation with those people, as it
was not at all impossible that a seemingly careless
question might obtain some accidental clue
to information. Lord L⸺ smiled incredulously,
but checked his horse, and Mr. Jackson,
adapting his language to his company, and
addressing the man nearest him, said, “Have
you had many people to see the Bottom lately?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole troop halted and wheeled, for they
had just begun to move forward. Their intrepid
leader, finding herself, by this unexpected
evolution, in the centre of her forces, placed
the fore-feet of her beast on a mound of earth,
to give herself a certain elevation above the
rest, planted her arms a-kimbo, and assumed a
listening attitude, “I doon’t na I’s sure,” replied
the man spoken to. A second fellow
here interposed with, “It’s no se lang sine Sir
Sydney was doon wid——”</p>

<p>“Haud yeer gab, ye feul!” interrupted our
Amazon, in a voice of authority. “Sir Sydney,
indeed! Its lang enew sine Sir Sydney was
doon! He’s no been on dry land for monny a
day.”</p>

<p>“And pray,” inquired Mr. Jackson, who
remembered the mention he had once heard of
the name from the lips of Henry, “who is Sir
Sydney?”</p>

<p>“The best friend,” replied the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
had just been interrupted, “the Bottom folk
hay.”</p>

<p>“No but a feller that’s oot on his mind,”
said Jin of the Gins, with a marked impatience,
which she endeavoured to screen, by increasing
boldness of deportment, and repeated kicks on
the sides of her charger. He, however, was in
no haste to move, and the man replied again:
“He may be no just quite right; bit he gives
folk plenty te drink, for aw that!”</p>

<p>“Out of his mind!” repeated Mr. Jackson.
“But did you not say, that the last time this
Sir Sydney was down, he had gentlefolk with
him?” Now, Mr. Jackson was quite aware,
that the fellow had not yet said so.</p>

<p>“Gentlefolk?” repeated the man, “whough
aye: ’at was the night ’at——”</p>

<p>Here he was again interrupted with a repetition
of, “Haud yeer gab, ye feul,” from Jin,
who now speaking angrily, and addressing Mr.
Jackson, said, with her large sooty arm out-stretched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and pointing towards Whitehaven,
“Gang yeer gate, and let us gang oors: we
hey ney time te clatter nonsense aboot crazy
folk!”</p>

<p>Then, with a more determined effort than
before, she forced the wretched animal she rode,
to raise its unwilling head, lift its ponderous
hoofs, and, finally, urged by reiterated kicks
and curses, to move forward. The renewed
clanking of the chains, that trailed on the
ground on either side, duly accompanying her
progress; while the rest of the troop, deeming
some mark of courtesy due to gentlemen who
had given them money to drink, set up a parting
cheer, as they followed in her track; soon
after which, they recommenced their own coarse
jests, and loud laughter.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ thought the sum of information
obtained, did not amount to much. But Mr.
Jackson reminded him that Sir Sydney was
the appellation ascribed by Henry, many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
since, to a very remarkable looking person,
whom he, Mr. Jackson, had seen in very familiar
conversation with Henry.</p>

<p>This certainly was a sort of clue; and Jin’s
unwillingness to let the men speak, looked
suspicious. It seemed highly probable that
both Jin and Sir Sydney were agents of
Henry’s.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen now proceeded to some
of the overseers of the works, where they learnt
that the person, called by the colliers and rabble
of the Gins, Sir Sydney, was a madman
who fancied the coal vessels the British fleet,
and himself an admiral; and who was thence
called, in derision, Sir Sydney Smyth. They
next repaired to the magistrates, who, on hearing
all the particulars, recommended that no
alarm should be given, by any premature examination
of Jin of the Gins; but, that they
should wait till the man, calling himself Sir
Sydney, should make his appearance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
then apprehend him and all his associates
together.</p>

<p>This plan being approved of by all parties,
was adopted accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Euphrasia was cruising off the French
coast, when, one morning, Fitz-Ullin, who
was walking the quarter-deck, discovered,
what appeared to be a sail in shore. On
using his glass, however, he perceived that
there were two, the one a large privateer, the
other a smaller vessel ahead, of which the
privateer seemed to be in pursuit. He immediately
issued orders to make all sail and give
chace. In a little time the privateer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
within pistol-shot of the headmost ship, but,
being closely pressed by the Euphrasia, she
was obliged to content herself with the wanton
mischief of firing one gun as she passed.</p>

<p>She had hitherto been to windward of the
frigate, she now bore away, with the evident
intention of crossing her bows, when the
wind, suddenly shifting, threw her all aback.
The Euphrasia shortly after came up with her,
upon which, seeing no further chance of escape,
she slackened sail and fell almost alongside.
While the crew of the Euphrasia were
busily engaged taking in their sails, Fitz-Ullin,
who was looking out for the lowering of the
privateer’s colours, observed some of her men
pointing a long twenty-four pounder, which
was placed in the centre of their deck, and
which appeared to turn on a pivot. At first,
he could scarcely believe that so useless a
piece of cruelty could be intended; seeing
them, however, actually about to apply the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
match, he ordered the small armed party of
marines to fire a volley into the midst of them.
In a moment, the fellows who had been employed
about the gun were swept away. This
destructive piece of ordnance was afterwards
found to be loaded with buck shot, old nails,
and crooked pieces of iron. Had it been discharged
from so short a distance, on the, just
then, necessarily crowded decks of the frigate,
the havoc must have been dreadful.</p>

<p>The privateer was now boarded, and her
Captain found to be too ill to leave his berth.
This circumstance, however, was not attended
with any inconvenience, as it would have been
necessary, at any rate, to leave the Captain in
the prize, to facilitate her condemnation. The
rest of the crew, with the exception of one
black, for whose attendance the sick Captain
sent an urgent petition, were taken on board
the Euphrasia, and a proper complement of
her men sent into the prize, with a midshipman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
as prize master. By the time, however,
that these necessary arrangements were completed,
the aspect of the weather changed so
much, that Fitz-Ullin judged it not prudent,
under the possible circumstances, to entrust
so considerable a prize to the care of a midshipman.
Accordingly, at about ten o’clock
at night, he sent Henry on board, with orders
to take the command, and forthwith sail for
Plymouth.</p>

<p>Henry finding from the midshipman whom
he relieved, that every needful preparation was
already made, went immediately to his cabin.
He saw neither the sick captain nor his black,
the first never having quitted his berth, and
the second having retired to his, two hours
before, neither having any thing to do with
the business of the ship.</p>

<p>The breeze was brisk, and soon parted them
many miles from the Euphrasia.</p>

<p>Henry had, as usual, heated his blood with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
wine at supper, and in consequence lay tossing
and restless. At length, however, about twelve
o’clock, he fell into a perturbed slumber.
Shortly after, he dreamed that he heard his
cabin-door open softly. He started awake,
and, notwithstanding the utter darkness, was
sensible that something moved, though noiselessly,
towards him.</p>

<p>The next moment he felt a hand laid, with
the fingers spread open, on his shoulder, and
passed from thence to his breast, as if to ascertain
his exact position. He leaped up, grappled
with the invisible intruder, and strove to
seize the right arm, which, from its being
greatly elevated above the head, he supposed
to wield some deadly weapon. In the struggle
they pushed through the doorway of the little
cabin, into the outer one. Henry felt that,
though the figure was tall, and in its proportions
athletic, he was himself, he thought, the
stronger, certainly the more elastic of the two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Still, no effort he could make, could bend the
right arm downwards. If he attempted to use
both hands for the purpose, the left arm of his
antagonist tightly encircled his waist, to the
endangering of his footing; in so much that
with his left he was obliged to clasp with equal
closeness his invisible assailant. While they
thus wrestled, locked in each other’s embrace,
Henry, who had not had presence of mind, indeed
scarcely time, to do so sooner, called out,
“On deck there!” A foot was heard coming
below. The vigilance of Henry’s attention
was taken off for a second. The uplifted arm
descended with the quickness of lightning, and
a dagger was plunged, up to the hilt, in his
side. He uttered a species of yell, leaped from
the ground, fell, and groaned heavily, muttering
from between his closing teeth: “Hell and
the Devil, I am murdered!”</p>

<p>“Henry!” exclaimed a well known voice,
rendered terrible by horror, amazement, and
despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment, the person who had been
heard approaching, entered, carrying a dark
lantern, which, while it left the intruder in
shadow, threw a strong light on the form of
Henry, writhing in agony on the ground;
his countenance distorted, and his eyes still
wide open. He turned them, as the light appeared,
on the figure of his late violent assailant,
now standing over him, horror-stricken and
motionless. A frightful sort of smile divided
the lips of Henry; the eyes fixed, a few convulsive
movements of the limbs followed, and
then, one fearful spasm, evidently the last,
closed his mortal career.</p>

<p>“It is my son!” said the murderer.</p>

<p>The man who had just entered, paused and
gazed on the scene before him, with an unmeaning
stare. Placing the lantern, while he
did so, under his arm, it glared its light upwards
on his own countenance, which proved
to be that of a peculiarly brutal looking black.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
The balls of the eyes shone in the partial gleam,
and the thick turned-over lips, being spread by
a horrible grin, displayed a wide range of glaring
white teeth.</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to have defined
exactly the source of this wretch’s grin; for
he was sufficiently in the secrets of his master
to know that the murder of Henry could not
have been intended. But, there was a demoniac
glee at the sight of suffering and death; and
surprise at the strange mistake, and curiosity
to see what effect it would have on him most
interested. The grin which those mixed feelings
had produced, still remained on his face,
and seemed to have been forgotten there,
while stooping, and flaring the light across and
across, over the prostrate figure of Henry, as
if to ascertain that life was quite extinct, he
said, as he raised himself and gave his head a
knowing nod, “We must not lose the ship
for this though!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>The aroused murderer snatched the lantern
from him, and flinging himself on his knees
beside the corse, held the light close to Henry’s
pale face: paused—shuddered—closed the eyes
of the dead—then the lips, which agony had
left parted while the teeth were clenched; laid
the lantern on the ground, tore open the breast
of the shirt, placed his hand on the heart, remained
for some moments motionless, holding
in his breath; then, perhaps unconsciously,
heaved a sigh as deep and tremulous as though
it had issued from the gentlest of bosoms, and
proceeded to examine the wound.</p>

<p>“There are two ribs broken!” he murmured
to himself, as he continued the scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I was quite sure,” interposed the black,
approaching a step, “that the midshipman I
told you of, was our prize-master: I saw no
other officer come aboard of us. It was your
own order, that I should turn in, and keep clear
of the men, and seem to take no concern in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
what was going on, till after the first watch was
relieved, and then to be sure to come on deck,
and keep near the cabin-door.”</p>

<p>“<em>Damnation! Damnation! Damnation!</em>”
muttered the still kneeling murderer, without
withdrawing his eyes from the face of the corse,
and grinding, as it were, each utterance of the
word beneath his clenched teeth, ere he suffered
it to pass. Then, starting up, he hastened
on deck, (followed by the black,) strode
towards the steersman, held a pistol to his
head, and swearing he would blow his brains
out if he made the slightest resistance, tied him
down with cords. The same threat was used
by the black, to the man who had the lookout,
and whom they also tied. The desperate
pair of ruffians then proceeded to the hatchways
which they had previously fastened down,
and ordering the remainder of the crew to
come up, one by one, bound each, as he appeared,
with the exception of two foreigners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
who volunteered to assist them in taking the
ship into a French harbour.</p>

<p>They then altered the course of the thus
recovered prize, and stood towards Brest.</p>

<p>The storm which Fitz-Ullin had foreseen,
had been for some time gradually rising; it
soon became so high as to render the privateer
with so few efficient hands, very unmanageable;
there was also distant thunder, and occasional
flashes of lightning. The wind, however,
being favourable for the French coast, they
allowed the vessel to drive before it, and seemed
resolved to perish rather than yield to their
prisoners; for this, from the superiority in
numbers of the latter, must have been the
alternative, had they let them loose to obtain
their assistance.</p>

<p>After some hours, but while it was still quite
dark, they ran foul of another vessel. On board
both ships, some moments of the most awful
suspense followed: neither crew could be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
first aware, what degree of injury their vessel
had sustained; nor was it immediately possible,
in consequence of the darkness, to ascertain
whether their dangerously near neighbour
were friend or foe. They were endeavouring,
through the din of the elements, to hail each
other, when a peculiarly vivid flash of lightning
struck and shattered the upper half of
the main-mast of the privateer, while the lower
part of the mast continued standing, but took
fire and instantly became a blazing torch of
gigantic dimensions, illuminating, from end to
end, with perfect distinctness, the decks of both
vessels. That of the frigate presented the
usual crowd and bustle attendant on the circumstances;
while that of the privateer was
nearly desolate, rendering the more remarkable
the figure of the murderer and that of his black
assistant, standing in the glare of the burning
mast, and, with looks of dismay, recognising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
in the vessel alongside of which their own lay,
their late captor, the Euphrasia.</p>

<p>The privateer could offer no resistance: she
was of course retaken. It would be difficult to
describe the horror of those who now boarded
the thus twice captured prize, on finding what
had happened, and discovering the body of
Henry. Still less would it be possible to paint
the feelings of Fitz-Ullin, when the account of
the murder was brought to him.</p>

<p>The Euphrasia having received some injury,
(being lying-to when the privateer ran on
board of her,) a homeward course became desirable.
As soon, therefore, as wind and weather
would permit, Fitz-Ullin took Henry’s
body on board, and proceeded to Plymouth.
From thence he instantly wrote to Mr. Jackson
with the melancholy intelligence, that he
might break it to the family with proper caution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>The prize, which was very valuable, was also
brought safe into port, the burning mast having
been extinguished in time to prevent the spreading
of the fire.</p>

<p>Having sent the murderers to Exeter gaol to
be tried for their lives at the assizes, which were
to commence in a day or two, and made whatever
arrangements the duties of the service
required, Fitz-Ullin set out for Lodore, whither,
according to instructions received from
Mr. Jackson, he gave orders to have the body
of Henry conveyed. So contradictory and unsearchable
are often the movements of the human
heart, that, melancholy as were these
duties, it is certain that our hero performed
them with an activity and energy of spirit, to
which he had long been a stranger. Whether
it was, that tired of his self-imposed banishment,
he was glad of even this mournful excuse,
to renew the affectionate intercourse of
early life with a family so long and so justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
regarded, by offering his services on the present
occasion, and giving his necessary assistance
in prosecuting the murderers to conviction;
or, whether any other, and more mysterious
springs of thought and feeling were set
in motion, it would be difficult to determine.</p>

<p>However this was, in a few days after his
landing, he was to be seen, with a countenance
of seriousness, certainly, but not of despair,
leaning back in a travelling carriage which
rolled along the north road as fast as the
united strength of four good horses could give
the impetus of motion to its wheels.</p>

<p>He arrived at Keswick, drove through it, and
shortly after a turning in the road presented
Lodore House to his view.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> an almost involuntary movement he put
an arm out the window, opened the door himself,
kicked the steps half down, leaped over
them, and, either without waiting for, or without
remembering Arthur, crossed the lawn on
foot and alone; while the carriage, its door
flapping, its steps hanging, and its master
missing, took the usual course, and drove up
to the principal entrance.</p>

<p>No sooner had our hero passed the threshold
of the half-open glass door, which had thus
attracted him, than he beheld Julia. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
alone, dressed, of course, in mourning, and
seated at a table over which she stooped, in the
act of writing or drawing. He stood; she
looked up. An expression of pleasure sparkled
for a moment in her eyes.</p>

<p>Julia, in the hurry of the moment, pronounced
the name of Edmund. She had not
seen Fitz-Ullin at Lodore since other names
and titles had been added to that which was
associated in her feelings, with the scenes and
remembrances of childhood. He too pronounced
her name, as, with visible agitation, he
took the hand of welcome she held out. After
thus naming each other, however, neither spoke
again; while he examined her countenance
with an earnestness, which at first pained, and
at last offended her.</p>

<p>“Julia! Julia!” he at length said. Then
burying his face in both his hands, against the
arm of a sofa on which he flung himself, he
added: “we are alone?” After a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
pause he looked up; Julia, to hide the confusion
occasioned by so strange an address,
was stooping to caress a dog of Fitz-Ullin’s,
which, since its first entrance, had been importuning
for notice. Our hero, with a bitter
smile, arose and walked towards a window.</p>

<p>“Surely” he murmured to himself, “I need
not wish—I need not desire—yet—nothing—nothing
short of infatuation could extenuate—”</p>

<p>The entrance of Lord L⸺, followed shortly
by Frances, and soon after by Lady Oswald,
who was now on a visit at Lodore, put an end
to this strange interview. The dreadful occurrence
of the murder was fresh in the minds of
all. The subject was entered upon immediately:
they spoke of how severely Mrs. Montgomery
had felt the shock. Particulars were minutely
enquired into by Lord L⸺, and many comments
made by each in turn. Julia, indeed,
said the least; for she found that, whenever she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
spoke, Fitz-Ullin watched every word that fell
from her lips, with a kind of attention which
was distressing, as well as embarrassing, and
she shortly therefore quitted the room. Frances,
who had done so before, now returned
with a message from her grandmamma, requesting
that Fitz-Ullin would go to her, as
she was unable to leave her own apartment.</p>

<p>On obeying the summons he had received,
Fitz-Ullin found his kind old friend sitting up
in her bed, and Mr. Jackson and Julia with
her, endeavouring to compose her spirits.</p>

<p>She was greatly affected on seeing Fitz-Ullin,
and shed tears, which she had not before
done; for there was, she said, a horror
mingled with her sorrow for Henry, which
would not suffer her to weep. She feared that
he had died without a just sense of religion.
Fitz-Ullin said, with some hesitation, that he
had latterly possessed much of Henry’s confidence,
and that he had reason to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
he had fixed his hopes of happiness, (in this
life at least,) where no ungentle feeling could
find a place—where, indeed, scarcely a temptation
to err could have reached him, and
where the purest Christian principles would
have been daily cultivated by the hand of
domestic affection; and that such ties, he
should hope, no man would voluntarily seek
while he continued to be the sport of unfixed
opinions, or the slave of irregular habits.
Julia and Fitz-Ullin left Mrs. Montgomery’s
room together. As soon as he had closed the
door, he stopped short, took one of her hands
in both of his, and looked full in her face with
an expression of tender, or rather kindly enquiry,
for there was no presumption in his
manner. He pronounced her name, then paused.
She met his scrutinizing gaze with a
countenance, first of surprise, and, finally, displeasure,
withdrew her hand, and, without
speaking, preceded him to the drawing-room.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day the papers were filled with an
account of the trial of the murderers of Mr.
Henry St. Aubin. The murder was proved;
yet, strange to say, the murderers were acquitted.</p>

<p>The Captain of the privateer spoke his own
defence. He was, he said, a Frenchman fighting
for his country. He was not, even by the
laws of war, a prisoner; for he had not lowered
his colours. He had as good a right to recover
possession of his ship as the English had in
the first instance to capture her; and if lives
were lost in the struggle, it was but the fate of
war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>This defence was admitted, and the midnight
murderer of his own son acquitted by the blindness
of mortal judgment.</p>

<p>The papers proceeded to state that the murderers
having been remanded for a fresh trial
on fresh charges, the principal was found the
next morning alone in the prison with his
brains beat out. The black had made his escape.
The particulars were supposed to be as follows:
The villains had first, it would appear, by their
united strength, forced a bar of their window.
From the bloody appearance at one end of
the heavy iron weapon thus obtained, and
the battered state of the head of the privateer
captain, it was quite evident that the black had
used the bar to knock down and murder his
master; whom, as the wretch was his inferior
in strength, he must have taken unawares. A
large wound on the back of the head of the deceased,
strengthened this opinion. It was supposed
that the black’s motive for committing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
this crime, must have been his knowledge of
where to lay his hands on the ill-gotten wealth
of his master, of which he hoped thus to obtain
undisturbed possession. The papers further
stated, as the reason why the prisoners had
been remanded, that the magistrates had had
information respecting the privateer captain
having been largely concerned both with pirates
and smugglers on various parts of the coast.
One very suspicious circumstance was, they
ascertained, clearly proved, namely, his identity
as the individual who had for so many
years imposed on the inhabitants of Whitehaven
and its vicinity, by passing for a madman,
and calling himself Sir Sydney Smyth.
The very nature of the derangement he thus
feigned afforded a pretext for lounging about
the quays and the coast at all hours. On reading
this paragraph, Lord L⸺ and Mr. Jackson
exchanged looks.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> body of Henry arrived. The day of the
funeral came, and passed. Still the silence of
Fitz-Ullin towards Julia continued, and her’s
towards him was equally remarkable. Not
that he now avoided her, as he had done on
board the Euphrasia; on the contrary, he rather
sought to be near her; but his close attention
to all she said or did, seemed a sort of scrutiny,
and gave her more pain than pleasure.
He now indeed appeared even to court occasions
of being alone with her; yet, when such
did occur, he spoke little, and on indifferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
subjects, and maintained the air of one who
expected some communication to be made to
him. While Julia met his strange manner
with a studied coldness of deportment, which
seemed to forbid all recurrence to the past,
the ungenerous determination he appeared to
have formed of reading her heart, whilst he
refrained from entitling himself to do so, at
length aroused her to self-defence at least, if
not to indignation. She was weary of the inward
humiliation of feeling, that her heart
beat responsive to every alternation of his
manner; that the tone of his voice, the turn
of his eye, could make her happy or miserable.
Yet, was she still weak enough to be less positively
wretched than she would else have been,
from the idea that, unworthy and impertinent
as his conduct appeared, she could not be quite
an object of indifference to him, or he would
not study her as he did. He did not watch
every look, every word when Frances spoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
or was spoken to. The subject, however, was
one on which she now shrank from speaking,
even to Frances; and one on which that kind
and considerate sister felt that, it would be as
indelicate as useless to speak to her. Frances
did certainly more than once observe, with a
warmth which Julia but too well understood,
how disagreeable rank and fortune had made
Edmund; with his Lady Julia L⸺, and
Lady Frances L⸺, adding, “I declare I am
sometimes going to laugh, only I am so angry
I could almost cry; it does seem so ridiculous!”</p>

<p>While Julia’s manners were such as we have
described, in those of Lord L⸺ there was
a daily increasing haughtiness, and in his politeness
an attention to forms, calculated to
remind a guest that he was not at home.
Frances, too, though still friendly, was less a
sister than formerly. Fitz-Ullin seemed to feel
all this, for he began to talk of leaving Lodore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
though the Euphrasia was not ready for sea,
Mrs. Montgomery, indeed, was still kind, and,
while he sat at her bed-side, she would still call
him Edmund, look anxiously in his face, shake
her head, and tell him he was not happy. She
would then rally him about Lady Susan; calling
the affair his boyish disappointment. Then
she would wish he could make a second choice,
and give her the joy of seeing him happy before
she died.</p>

<p>A secret association of ideas in the good old
lady’s mind, would lead her to talk, very soon
after, of Julia.</p>

<p>On such occasions Fitz-Ullin’s colour would
come and go; yet, even with this affectionate
friend, he continued silent. At length his
spirits becoming evidently more depressed,
he announced his determination of taking
his departure immediately, as he wished, he
said, to visit Ayrshire before the Euphrasia
was ready for sea, that he might make one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
more effort on behalf of Arthur, though with
scarcely a hope of success; Lady Oswald having
already made every exertion. But, young
Oswald having no title to show, it was found
impossible to disturb the present possessors.
If, however, the title-deeds could be found, it
was the opinion of counsel, that there would be
no difficulty in recovering the property, as the
papers themselves would shew (what was well
known, though it could not be legally proved,)
that Sir Archibald had no power to dispose of
more than his life interest in the estates.</p>

<div class="verse">“When the will’s at enmity with the task before us, we love to dally in performance.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fitz-Ullin</span> was now on the point of quitting
Lodore. Yet he lingered. There seemed to
be something that he wished to say, or do, before
he went; still he did nothing, and said
little. At length, finding Julia one morning
alone in the library, he took a seat beside her.
She trembled visibly; yet were her feelings not
altogether painful: there was a strange mixture
of hope. He remained for a long time silent,
either mastering some emotion, or considering
how to commence. “Julia,” he at last said,
for, in his agitation, he forgot the title; “do
not mistake me! do not suppose that I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
to speak of myself, or of my own feelings; I
am too well aware what yours have been, to
be guilty of conduct so indelicate. Have been,
did I say? rather, what I must suppose they
still are, though you have, Julia, so well, so
wonderfully maintained the struggle, so successfully
concealed every emotion. But surely,
those sentiments, however tenderly cherished
their secret remembrance may be, and I confess,
though such a declaration from me may
seem strange, I confess that, even I, who have
had so much cause to mourn that ever they
found a place in your bosom, even I should
not like to see you capable of the levity, of
casting them thence in a moment. But, as I
was about to say, surely they need not deprive
me of that sisterly regard, that calm, unimpassioned
friendship, which is all I ask; and
which you have even so often promised me
should be mine for ever. If I, too, must resign
every warmer feeling, need I be deprived, also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of this sweet solace, without which the burden
of existence is intolerable! Julia, you look
shocked, you look offended. I had not dared
to have entered on such a topic—but—but—your
surprising self-command deceived me: I
thought you could have borne it better. And—and—I
did suppose, that the bitterness of my
own disappointed hopes might have been some
apology; that—I might have been heard, with
pity, at least.”</p>

<p>“Is he mad?” thought Julia. “Does he
deem it necessary to apologize to me, because
his lingering love for another will not suffer
him to offer me more than friendship? And
does he, can he mean to tell me to my face,
that he has long seen my weak, wretched,
mean devotion to himself, yet cannot return
it? And, therefore, he would school me into
moderating my attachment for him—rendering
it of a calmer—nay—a less impassioned nature!
Good heavens, is it come to this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>With these thoughts passing rapidly through
her mind, she had risen from her seat while he
was yet speaking. She now stood, for a few
moments, motionless, and covered with burning
blushes; then, clasping her hands and
lifting her eyes to heaven, but without suffering
them, for an instant, to meet Fitz-Ullin’s,
she turned, and fled the room.</p>

<p>Arrived in her own, she sat down, unable
even to think! A summons to dinner was the
first thing that aroused her, (though two full
hours had elapsed). It found her cold, and
pale; while her eyes were so disfigured by the
traces of tears, she had been long unconsciously
shedding, that she was obliged to excuse
herself from appearing at dinner.</p>

<p>When she was next in company with Fitz-Ullin,
which was, of necessity, that evening,
she carefully avoided meeting his eyes, keeping
her own always on the ground. She never
addressed him; when he addressed her, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
answered, without looking up, and by monosyllables
pronounced in a voice scarcely audible,
and immediately spoke to some one else. Fitz-Ullin
seemed conscious that he had committed
some error; for more than once in the course
of the evening, he found an opportunity when
none were near, to entreat her pardon in a low,
hurried tone. He received neither word nor
look in reply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Fitz-Ullin found it impossible
to be a moment alone with Julia. She fled all
such occasions, with a species of terror, which
astonished him. In the evening he met her
suddenly in the shrubbery.</p>

<p>“What can I have done, Julia?” he said,
snatching the tremulous hand with which she
was hastily endeavouring to open a little paling
gate for the purpose of turning into another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
walk, evidently to avoid him. “Am I no
longer that Edmund whom you have honoured
with the name of brother, since—since before
you could pronounce the word distinctly? Or
can I be expected to forget, entirely, that you
are still the same Julia, the same dearest, best
beloved object of my earliest, and fondest affections!—”
He stopped short suddenly, as
though he had been betrayed into expressions
he had not meant to use. Julia’s lip trembled,
her eyes were fixed on the ground, and every
feature convulsed by efforts to restrain her tears.</p>

<p>“I see I am but adding to my offence,” he
recommenced, “I but seem to you to insult
feelings which ought now to be sacred; with
which, you think, and justly, I ought not, on
the strength of my knowledge of them, to trifle:
nor do I, heaven knows, entertain such a
thought! But, what have I done? why must
I be denied your friendship? the continuation
of your confidence? Do not mistake me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Mine, Julia, mine are, I repeat it, but the claims
of a brother.”</p>

<p>Julia’s colour rose. “For heaven’s sake,
what do you mean? what do you dare to mean?”
she exclaimed, and wrenching her hand from
him, without waiting his reply, she hastened
to the house. He attempted to follow; but
she waved to him, to remain where he was.
That evening, Julia avoided him more than
ever; and with an expression, too, on her
countenance, of less gentle displeasure than she
had ever before evinced. When she was leaving
the supper room, he added to his good night,
“I am going to-morrow; early, very early;”
extending, at the same time, a hand to each of
the sisters.</p>

<p>These words arrested the step of Julia for a
moment. She yielded a trembling hand, and
attempted to utter a good night.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the morning Julia stole from the side of
Frances, at a very early hour, and seated herself
near a window. For a time all was still.
At length she heard a step in the hall, then a
gentle tap at a, not very distant, room door;
then, the well known voice of Fitz-Ullin
answering from within with that urbanity of
tone for which he was so remarkable, the servant
who had told him the hour. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
followed by various slight noises; then the
wheels of a carriage on the gravel beneath her
window; then Fitz-Ullin’s step, quitting his
apartment, and crossing the hall; then the clap
of the carriage-door, followed immediately by
the sound of the wheels again, but in quicker
motion than before. She now saw Fitz-Ullin’s
travelling carriage drive away. As it turned,
in doing so, she caught, through a screen of
jessamine, which, overgrowing her window, concealed
her, one momentary view of the countenance
of our hero. It was very pale, and he was
looking towards the very window so screened,
with a settled melancholy of expression, which
seemed to convey to Julia’s heart a presentiment
that they should never meet again.</p>

<p>She had maintained all this time an unnatural
degree of composure; a passion of
tears now came to her relief. Till being reminded
by a slight movement of Frances,
that, should her sister awake and speak to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
her, all reserve must, she felt, henceforward
be at an end, and a contemptible weakness,
for which she heartily despised herself, be
thus exposed, she determined to steal out
softly to the breakfast room, where, throwing
herself on a sofa, she lay in all the listlessness
of despondency for an hour and half, at the
end of which time she was aroused by the
sound of a carriage driving up to the door.
Her heart palpitated violently. “What can
have brought him back?” she thought. She
heard a bustle in the hall, and one of the men
servants’ voices calling to Alice, and enquiring
if Lady Julia was up yet. Shortly after, steps
approached the door of the breakfast room, it
opened.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gotterimo</span>, carrying a small box and parcel,
was ushered in by Alice. Never did our old
acquaintance meet with a reception so little
cordial from Julia. She had fully expected
to see Fitz-Ullin enter, and, possessed with
that idea, had sprung from the sofa, placed
herself at a table, flung open a large volume
before her, and arranged the expression of
her countenance, for the purpose of meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
him with proper dignity. The bows and
smiles, therefore, of the little pedlar but
poorly compensated for her disappointment.</p>

<p>Unwelcomed, he approached and laid down
the box and parcel. The latter, on having
the silk handkerchief in which it was tied,
removed, and coming in contact with the
table, resolved itself into numerous loose letters,
which, escaping from the piece of red
tape that once had confined them, spread
themselves before the eyes of our heroine.
They were evidently old ones, many of them
being much discoloured and abused, and the
seals, seemingly, of all broken.</p>

<p>Gotterimo, with an air of mingled mystery
and self-gratulation, said, “Dis be your ladyship
box of de fine ting. I have show it to
de captain, (nice gentleman is de captain!)
I vos bring it to your ladyship vid dese letters,
for dis reason, dat von of dem be direct to
you ladyship. So I have told him, but he no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
look. He desire me no show dem to him,
nor odder person but you ladyship, because de
be vid you ladyship box, and so de must belong
you ladyship.”</p>

<p>Julia saw, by a single glance at the box,
that it was that which had contained her
jewels, and which had been taken out of her
room on the memorable evening that she had
been carried away from Lodore House. “It
is certainly my box,” she said, “but where
in the world did you find it, Mr. Gotterimo?”</p>

<p>“I have got all dese tings, madam, in a vey
dat be var strange. I vil just take to mineself
de liberty to tell you ladyship, if it be not von
great trouble, fen you listen.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Julia, “pray, how was
it?”</p>

<p>“You see, madam,” he commenced, “I am
now, tank to you ladyship and you good family,
do var vell in de vorld. I have got, you
see, de big shop dat be de broker shop, so vel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
as mine pretty little shop for de fine ting. So,
fen de prize agent people be selling de property
out of de big privateer ship, I did go to
buy de bargain. And so I do buy, vid odder
tings, de von big chest, var cheep; and I vos
tink, von day, to make mine chest var clean,
and I jump in mineself, and up jump de von
bottom, and in between de two bottom vos dis
little box. So, fen I did open de little box, I
see in it all de fine ting belong you ladyship.
Oh, de did look so pretty, all in dere own place

madam; I shake mine head, so dat de tought

de be de fine ting of de lady dat be so goot to
me; so I vill take dem to her myself. She
have pay for dem before, and she sall have dem
now for nottin.”</p>

<p>Julia’s hand, meantime, had passed lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
over the loose heap of letters that lay on the
table before her. As they slid aside at her
touch, her eye had been caught by the hand-writing
in which one, addressed to herself, was
directed. Her colour had fled, and returned of
a deeper dye, in almost the same moment.</p>

<div class="verse">Which, though so soon withdrawn, too gentle seem’d</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> had opened the letter, was reading, and
had become so much absorbed, that she had not
only ceased to hear what Gotterimo said, but
was no longer conscious even of his presence.
He began to perceive this, and with instinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
politeness, though with a feeling of much disappointment,
first became silent, and then,
fearing he might be troublesome, after fidgeting
a little, and coughing once or twice, left
the room.</p>

<p>Julia, without perceiving his departure, continued
reading till she had twice begun and
twice finished the letter. Then, laying it open
on her bosom, and crossing her hands upon
it, she raised her streaming eyes to heaven.
The door from the library opened: she withdrew
her eyes from their upward gaze, and
they rested on Fitz-Ullin. “Oh, Edmund!”
she exclaimed, and hastily presenting the letter
to him, she covered her face with both her
hands, and leaned on the table. Fitz-Ullin
glanced at the open letter, and found it to be
one which he himself had written to our heroine
above a year before.</p>

<p>“Why, Julia,” he said, “should this letter,
which you have replied to so fully, so decidedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and so long since, now seem to surprise or
agitate you?”</p>

<p>“I never replied to it! I never received it!
I never saw it till this moment!” said Julia.</p>

<p>“What, Julia!” exclaimed Fitz-Ullin, sinking
on one knee beside her, and drawing both
her hands, from before her face, “do you indeed
tell me that you have not, in reply to
that letter, rejected the heart and hand it
offers?—rejected them, too, on the plea of a
prior and long cherished attachment to another,
that other—the unfortunate Henry St.
Aubin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never! never!” exclaimed Julia, with
a fervour of manner, tone of voice, and expression
of countenance, which carried at once
conviction and happiness to the heart of Edmund.
That look, that manner, not only said,
“I have not rejected,” they also said, “I will
accept!” Fitz-Ullin gazed upon her for some
moments in the silence of powerful emotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
“Julia,” he said, at length, in a voice scarcely
audible, “what a load of misery you have
removed from my heart!”</p>

<p>She returned the pressure of his hand without
affectation of reserve; but without the
power to speak. “Heavens,” he continued,
after a short pause, “that horrible certainty
in which every sense has been spell-bound for
the last twelve months of wretchedness, was
then but a dream! Oh, Julia, how gladly do
I awake from it!” Their eyes met as he
spoke; nor were hers immediately withdrawn,
though their lids trembled beneath the ardour
of his gaze. The Julia and Edmund of former
days seemed suddenly restored to each other
after a long, long separation: each seemed to
read the heart of the other, each wondered
that they could have doubted the truth of the
other. Both had been silent for some time.
“Julia,” said Fitz-Ullin, at length, in a low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
entreating voice, recollecting, though it must
be confessed, without much alarm, that Julia,
though she had denied having rejected him,
had not yet said one word about accepting
him, “how can I trust to the presumptuous
hopes with which my heart now throbs—how
can I dare to be thus happy till you have pronounced
my fate, till you have actually said
that you will be mine!” Julia replied only by
a look. “I may then,” said Fitz-Ullin, in
a low whisper, “speak to Lord L⸺, as
authorised by you?”</p>

<p>Julia breathed a very inaudible sort of a yes;
and Fitz-Ullin, who, to hear the important
monosyllable, had been obliged to venture his
face into a very dangerous neighbourhood, expressed
his delighted gratitude by as many
demonstrations of the feelings that said little
word of mighty consequences had inspired, as
he dare well evince; but, as to what exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
he said or did on the occasion, it is by no
means necessary to the development of our
narrative to record.</p>

<p>Julia no longer venturing to look up, her
eyes rested, as a sort of excuse for looking
down, on the open letter, which, having escaped
from Fitz-Ullin’s hand, now lay on her
knee. As she dwelt on the expressions it
contained of passionate tenderness dictated by
the pure enthusiasm of a First Love, the harrowing
descriptions of poor Edmund’s struggles
with his own heart, while he had believed
himself an obscure and nameless being altogether
unworthy of her, her tears flowed silently,
except that such was the stillness of all
else, that the fall of each on the paper might
be distinctly heard. Fitz-Ullin watched her
with inexpressible delight, fearing to breathe,
lest he should interrupt her. At length, tempted
by the tear, or the smile, or both, to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
what parts of his letter so much affected her,
he approached his face nearer the paper, (for
he was still kneeling,) and read with her, adding
emphasis to each tender expression by a
gentle pressure of one, or both the hands he
still held.</p>

<p>“When did you write this letter, Edmund?”
she at length asked.</p>

<p>“On the very day,” he replied, “on which
I became acquainted with my birth, when poor
Ormond’s rash attempt to put an end to his
existence prevented my setting out instantly
for Lodore, which I was, indeed, as the letter
mentions, in the very act of doing when the
alarm was given; for I had long enough vainly
struggled with my feelings, while duty and
honour forbade me to declare them; another
moment of suspense, therefore, when those
obstacles were removed, seemed not to be endured!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>“And did you say, then, that you received
a letter in reply purporting to be from me?”
asked Julia, “and——”</p>

<p>“I did,” answered Fitz-Ullin, “written in
your name, and to all appearance your hand,
and even style. I have preserved it, and can
shew it you. It contains a gentle, very kindly
worded, but, as I mentioned, decided rejection
of the proposals made in my letter; and states,
as the reason of that rejection, a secret, long
cherished attachment, and engagement to
Henry, to whom it declares you betrothed.
It then reminds me, in the most seemingly
artless and confiding manner, of many little
circumstances I must myself have observed;
and entreats me to keep inviolable the secret
thus entrusted to me, either till you should obtain
Lord L⸺’s consent, or, when of age,
have taken some decided step. It farther requests
me, not to make known to any of your
family my wishes, lest they should urge your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
acceptance of my hand. And, finally, it commands
me on pain of forfeiting your friendship
for ever, no more to renew the subject to yourself,
by the slightest allusion to it; even in
any private interview that might occur.</p>

<p>“On receiving this letter, I passed some days
in a species of delirium; I scarcely knew what
happened, but that I still continued apparently
in attendance on the sick bed of Ormond;
while horrible visions haunted me of every circumstance
which had at any time raised for a
moment suspicions of a secret understanding
subsisting between you and your cousin. These
were now received as fatal proofs, which long
before ought to have opened my eyes. The
past, with all its blissful, though presumptuous
hopes, was changed in a moment into a wilderness
on which I dared not look back! I
know I wrote to Mrs. Montgomery, and endeavoured
to observe your supposed injunction
of secrecy; but, of what I said, I have scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
an idea. My letter must have been wildly and
strangely worded.”</p>

<p>“That letter,” said Julia, and she smiled
archly, though blushingly, “we all thought
was written, in consequence of your disappointment,
(as we believed) about Lady Susan. Her
marriage, you know, took place just at that
time. And that unfortunate being, Henry too,”
she added, “confirmed this opinion, by declaring
that he was in your confidence; and
saying, that you had also written to him on the
subject, quite in despair!”</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin could not help smiling in his turn,
at the idea of his being in despair about Lady
Susan.</p>

<p>“On me too,” he rejoined, “Henry forced,
what he termed confidence. He has even given
me to read, on our last voyage, passages, purporting
to be from your correspondence with
himself, and containing messages to me, reiterating
your injunctions of secrecy. And once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
he showed me a picture, which he said you had
given him, asking if I thought it like. It was
like, really like. Judge with what feelings I
must have seen him approach it to his lips, and
replace it in his bosom! A heart-sickening sensation
followed, and my selfish regrets were,
for a time, lost in the certainty that you had
cast away the inestimable treasure of your affections
on a man who did not truly love you;
for, I felt that one who did, had been incapable
of the indelicate display I had just witnessed.”
Here Fitz-Ullin unconsciously sighed, as
though the sense of present felicity had been
overborne by the painful recollections which
pressed upon him, then added: “After this,
every circumstance, and when we met again,
Julia, every look and word was misconstrued
by me into confirmations of that fatal belief,
which, from the moment it took possession of
me, poisoned my very existence, and benumbed
every faculty but that of suffering! Why, Julia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
in that agonizing interview in the refreshment
room at Lord L⸺’s, such was the infatuation
of my despair, that I believed we fully understood
each other. You seemed to me to acknowledge,
that you had received my proposals;
for you even said that my letter had
given you much pain; I thought of course,
you spoke of this letter.”</p>

<p>“I meant,” interrupted Julia, “the then last
one to grandmamma, which gave us all pain, it
was written in so desponding a manner. But,”
she continued, colouring a little, “you spoke,
just now, of—of—circumstances, which had
raised momentary suspicions.” This opening
led to a conversation, in which the fears for our
hero’s safety which had so long influenced the conduct
of Julia towards her cousin, were confessed;
and the system of terror practised by
Henry, developed. A burst of fond and grateful
emotion on the part of Fitz-Ullin followed,
by which Julia was so much affected, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
when she tried to speak, her lip trembled, and
she was unable to articulate. She tried to
smile, but the struggle was too much for her:
she wept and laughed alternately, till she
alarmed Fitz-Ullin so much, that he would have
been almost tempted to have called for assistance,
could he well have withdrawn his own
support. Before Julia had half recovered,
Frances entered. She was tripping lightly towards
the bell, to ring for breakfast; when,
perceiving her sister and our hero, she stopped
in the middle of the room, the very statue of
surprise! Julia disengaged herself, hastily;
discovering, just at this moment, that the assistance
which had hitherto been so indispensable
as to render it quite proper, had now
ceased to be necessary. Fitz-Ullin started up,
and, flying towards Frances, seemed to meditate
a rather familiar species of salutation.
But she stepped back. She had, by this time,
made a choice of her own, and was not disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
to be embraced, as formerly, only for her
sister’s sake. She extended her hand, however,
which he took and kissed, as with an
expression of delight on his countenance which
she had not seen it wear for a long period,
and which looked like the sunshine of the
first bright day after a dreary winter, he exclaimed,
“Frances, I am now indeed your
brother!”</p>

<p>Frances approached her sister, who threw
herself into her arms, and hid her face in her
bosom, whispering: “Oh, Frances, how happy
I am. You were quite right, Edmund never
loved any one but me!” Frances smiled
archly, and looking in her sister’s face, whispered,
“<span class="smcap">First Love!</span> Julia.”</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ entered the room at this moment;
and Fitz-Ullin, seeing the sisters thus
engaged with each other, heroically resolved
on the mighty sacrifice, of tearing himself a
moment from Julia’s presence, for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
of confirming his happiness. He hastened forward,
therefore, and meeting Lord L⸺, requested
a few minutes private conversation with
him. His lordship bowed assent. They retired.
Fitz-Ullin, on entering the library, grasped
Lord L⸺’s hand, and named Julia. Lord
L⸺ looked dignified, and at a loss.</p>

<p>“I have loved her,” said Fitz-Ullin, “from
the days of childhood to the present hour!”</p>

<p>“What, then, could have induced you to
keep your sentiments so long a secret?” said
Lord L⸺. “But, I will confess, Fitz-Ullin——”
Here the gentlemen proceeded with
mutual confessions; till, being quite satisfied
with the knowledge thus obtained of each
other’s private opinions, they re-entered the
breakfast-room, with countenances of the most
perfect good humour. Lord L⸺ sought the
eye of Julia; and when he caught it for a moment,
smiled with a look, which added yet a
tinge to the blush that already dyed her cheek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
She stood in the recess of a glass-door, apart.
Fitz-Ullin was soon at her side. In a low
whisper, and without looking up, she said,
“I should like to speak to grandmamma before
we sit down to breakfast, and you may follow
me.” Both glided out unperceived.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> hero and heroine re-entered the house by
a similar glass-door, leading into Mrs. Montgomery’s
dressing-room, and were soon hand
in hand at her bed-side.</p>

<p>“My children,” said the good old lady,
looking kindly at them, “how happy you both
look this morning.”</p>

<p>“I, ma’am,” said Fitz-Ullin, “am the
happiest of all mortal beings! Julia—my own
Julia, whom I have loved from the moment
when you first placed her, not an hour old, in
my arms, that Julia—that cherished object of
my earliest and fondest affections—of my

ever knew, or ever can know, is now mine for
ever; by her own and by Lord L⸺’s consent—mine
for ever!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery looked at Julia, whose
blushes, as she embraced her grandmamma,
confirmed what Fitz-Ullin had said. “Kneel,
my children,” said the old lady, in a faltering
tone. “It is as it should be!” and she rose
in her bed as she spoke, and blessed them tenderly
and solemnly, uniting their hands; while
Mr. Jackson entering, a species of explanation
was given, in which, however, the name of
Henry was not mentioned. Mrs. Montgomery,
detaining Julia, dismissed both the gentlemen.
They, before their return to the breakfast-room,
took a short walk on the lawn, during
which Fitz-Ullin made Mr. Jackson acquainted
with those particulars respecting the conduct
of Henry, which it had been necessary to conceal
from Mrs. Montgomery. Thus satisfying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>

to society, from the effects of a disappointment

<div class="verse">“Keep still in fortune’s way, her unmeant gifts</div>
<div class="verse">Are oft the best!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> entering the breakfast-room, they found
that Lady Oswald had by this time joined the
party there.</p>

<p>Her ladyship contrived by looks, a kind
pressure of the hand, and a well-timed whisper,
to shew her nephew that she was fully
prepared to congratulate him on his new found
happiness.</p>

<p>Frances had, at length, completed her journey
to the bell, and by agitating it, had occasioned,
though at a later hour than usual, the
appearance of a steaming tea-urn, hot rolls,
&amp;c. &amp;c. She now began to dispense the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
things over which she presided, and had just
requested Fitz-Ullin to ring the bell for Alice
to take her grandmamma’s breakfast, when the
door opened, and, supported on one side by
our old friend, Mrs. Smyth, and on the other
by Julia, Mrs. Montgomery herself appeared.
Whether it was the extreme contrast between
the figures of the very old and the very young
lady, or the amiable light in which youth always
appears, while rendering support to the
infirmities of age, or whether Julia might, for
any reasons best known to herself, be really
looking more blooming or more happy than
usual, or whether there was any thing in Fitz-Ullin’s
own thoughts which diffused a peculiar
lustre over the charms of her he now viewed,
almost for the first time as his own, or, whether
all these causes operated together; certain it
is, he found one moment to think her more
lovely, more irresistibly attractive than ever, before
the bustle immediately occasioned by Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Montgomery’s entrance, commenced. It was
the first time that lady, so deservedly the object
of the love and veneration of all, had left
her room since she had heard of Henry’s
death. Every one rose to meet her—every one
hailed her approach with a joyful welcome—and
even Fitz-Ullin himself, in all the hurry
of his spirits, had the presence of mind to remember
the great chair in which she usually
sat, and to place it for her. He also succeeded
in finding the foot-stool, after twice stumbling
over it in the course of his researches;
and was, at length, amply rewarded by perceiving,
at the conclusion of his labours, that
the seat next to Julia had, by general consent,
been left for him.</p>

<p>Though the breakfast was rather a late one,
seldom has there been a meal at which all who
sat down to it were so truly happy. Those
most interested, indeed, were almost too much
so for enjoyment. The heart scarcely knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
how, thus quickly, to appropriate so much new
found felicity: at one moment it doubts the
reality of the very bliss it feels, and the next
trembles at being the repository of so great a
treasure.</p>

<p>The breakfast was ended, but no one moved;
all seemed unwilling to break up so happy an
assembly. Meanwhile, ungrateful world, the
author, or at least the importer of so much
joy, was, in the very intensity of that joy,
totally forgotten, till an exclamation from
Arthur, of “Oh, how beautiful!” drew pretty
general attention towards the small table, on
which the restored jewel box still stood open.</p>

<p>“That’s true!” said our heroine: “where
is poor Gotterimo? I have not thanked him for
his honesty in bringing back these things. I
forget, too, where it was he said he found
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lady Oswald!” exclaimed Fitz-Ullin,
“I forgot to mention it before, but—” and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
making two strides into the library, and one
back, carrying a pile of parchment, he continued—“Here
are the title-deeds of Arthur’s
estates.” Lady Oswald was near fainting.
Frances was obliged to assist in supporting
her.</p>

<p>“Why, Fitz-Ullin! where, in the name of
all that is marvellous, did these come from?”
said Lord L⸺, eagerly examining the parchments.</p>

<p>“I had them of the honest fellow who
brought back Lady Julia’s diamonds,” answered
Fitz-Ullin.</p>

<p>“But where?” “And when?” “And
how?” vociferated many voices.</p>

<p>“I met with the poor man this morning,”
replied our hero, “tumbled out of a gig on the
high road, a few miles from hence. A couple
of fellows were about to rob, and, I suppose,
murder him—” Here numerous exclamations
of horror and surprise interrupted the speaker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
At length he was permitted to proceed. “The
villains fled,” he continued, “at the first
sound of my carriage-wheels; but, on driving
up to the spot, I perceived a person lying on
the side of the road, and desired my servants
to stop and give any assistance in their power.
While they did so, having ascertained that the
man was not hurt, I leaned from the window,
enjoying the freshness of the morning air, and
began, I suppose, to think of something else;
for I found, in a short time after, that the poor
fellow had been throwing away many of his
best bows, and repeating frequently, ‘How
you do, sir?’ just under me, before I observed
him. When I returned his salutation, he said,
that he remembered me very well; for that he
had seen me at the house of the good family,
and that I was the nice Captain who had advised
the lady to buy the chain. He then told me a
very long story about a sea-chest, and about a
box of jewels, that he knew to be the property
of Lady Julia L⸺.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Frances, “for the box
is one which Julia happened to employ Gotterimo
to purchase for her in town; he could
have no doubt, therefore, to whom it belonged.”</p>

<p>“So he said,” rejoined our hero; “and that
finding these parchments lying near the box,
and with them some letters, one of which, he
said, was directed to Lady Julia L⸺, he
thought it most prudent to bring all to this
house. On glancing at the parchments,” continued
Fitz-Ullin, “which, as the little man
concluded his recital, he produced and offered
to me, and which bore their titles, in large
characters, on their outsides, I perceived immediately
their nature and importance; and
decided on returning to Lodore, for the purpose
of assisting Lady Oswald to establish the
rights of Arthur, rendered, by the recovery of
these documents, indisputable. As for the
letters, I should have considered it an unwarrantable
liberty in me to have examined even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
their outsides; I therefore recommended it to
Gotterimo to deliver them himself, with the
box, into Lady Julia’s own hands. This arrangement
made, I returned as quickly as
possible, and—”</p>

<p>“And, on your arrival,” interrupted Lady
Oswald, who was now a little recovered, “forgot
the very existence of Lady Oswald, title-deeds,
pedlar and all! This account of the
transaction, oh learned judges, wants that
consistency which is characteristic of the simple
truth,” added her ladyship, much amused.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin, who was saying something aside
to Julia, coloured, laughed, and replied, “I
read the deeds over very attentively, I assure
you, ma’am, in the library, on my first getting
out of the carriage, before I came into the
breakfast-room.”</p>

<p>“Oh then, it was in the breakfast-room you
happened to forget me and my parchments,”
said Lady Oswald, with a significant look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>“What have we got here?” exclaimed Lord
L⸺, examining a packet of the parchments,
which proved to be distinct from the rest,
though contained within the same outer envelope
of grey linen, “why, here are the
title-deeds of the Craigs!”</p>

<p>“Indeed! indeed!” cried various voices.</p>

<p>Gotterimo was now called for. “He was
very useful in the recovery of the pictures
and plate,” observed Lord L⸺. “By the
bye, Fitz-Ullin,” he added, turning to our
hero, “did you ever hear us mention that
daring robbery at the Craigs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied our hero, “I was one
of the luncheon party there the day it was
discovered.” As he concluded, he looked at
Julia, who looked again and smiled. What
multitudes of thoughts, on both sides, crowded
into that moment. “Well,” said Lord L⸺,
“it was chiefly through the means of this
Gotterimo, that the things have been recovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
He found out for us the persons to whom
the swindler had pawned the articles, and
though at the expense certainly of some of
the savings of minority, we have succeeded
in getting almost every thing into its place
again.”</p>

<p>Gotterimo, who had been sent for, was now
ushered in. Every one welcomed and thanked
him, and commendations of his honourable
and upright conduct, accompanied by assurances
that his services should be handsomely
rewarded, were poured upon him on
all sides. The little English he possessed, was
banished from his memory, bows and blushes
were all the replies he could offer. The gentlemen
then proceeded to question him respecting
the mode of discovering the parchments,
letters, &amp;c. He could give little more
information than had already been collected.
After the particulars, therefore, were all recapitulated
by him connectedly and at full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
length, he was dismissed, and commended to
the care of Mrs. Smyth, a destination to which
he had no objection, for poor Gotterimo had
lately begun to have some hopes of rendering
himself agreeable in the eyes of Alice Smyth,
who was already very agreeable in his eyes.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ requested Mr. Jackson to adjourn
with him to the library, for the purpose
of examining the packet of letters, which,
having been found with the parchments, might
possibly throw some light on the late mysterious
business. His lordship had also the
cruelty to ask Fitz-Ullin to assist them with
his judgment. Our hero had just whispered
a request to Julia to take a walk in the shrubbery,
and had just received a smile in assent.
What a disappointment!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">… “Now, unfold the mystery.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> trio of gentlemen proceeded to their task.
The first epistle which was casually unfolded,
exhibited but a few lines, wide asunder, and in
their purport so unimportant, that Mr. Jackson
flung the letter, spread open as it happened
to be, on the top of the fire, and proceeded to
take up a second. Lord L⸺, chancing to rest
his eyes on the first while the heat was causing
it to roll itself up, perceived, with some surprise,
that the spaces between the lines, as well
as all else that had appeared blank, was rapidly
becoming, as by magic, covered with
bright green characters. He snatched up the
paper just as the devouring flame was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
envelope it, and succeeded in saving all but a
small part. The green writing was in the
hand of Henry; and, to the utter astonishment
of all the party, addressed to his father—so
long supposed dead. The contents of the
letter equally puzzled and confounded our secret
committee, and decided them on comparing
all the hitherto unexamined, because
supposed to be unimportant, papers of Henry
with those before them.</p>

<p>They were accordingly sent for, and the
letters on both sides found to present, in black
ink, what appeared to be but the idle, careless
correspondence of two young messmates, while,
on being submitted to the ordeal of heat, they
were all found to contain, in green writing,
which, as it cooled, gradually disappeared
again, the strange and mysterious communications,
for many years, of father and son.
From these letters the following wonderful
discoveries were collected. The captain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
privateer, the murderer of the younger St.
Aubin, was shown to be the elder St. Aubin—the
father of the unfortunate Henry, who was
thus proved to have died by the hand of a
parent! The silent, heart-broken being, who
had so tenderly watched Julia, and who, there
can be little doubt, met her death by the explosion
of the smuggler, it appeared from all
the circumstances, was the ill-fated Maria,
Mrs. Montgomery’s sister. She, it seems, as
well as her depraved husband, had escaped
from the wreck of the vessel in which they had
both so many years since been supposed to be
lost.</p>

<p>The vessel in question, it may be remembered,
had specie on board. Some of the letters
contained casual expressions, from which
it might be gathered, that her foundering by
night was not quite accidental. And one in
particular, addressed by the elder St. Aubin
to the younger, contained an account of his fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
escape, as he termed it, with his black,
as much of the money as could conveniently be
carried, and his wife; and their landing on the
coast of France. The money obtained by this
very suspicious adventure seems, from many
after-allusions, to have been the first setting
up of the desperate St. Aubin, in his triple
calling of pirate, privateer, and smuggler, carried
on for so many years after, with various
degrees of success.</p>

<p>The whole correspondence, from its commencement
to its conclusion, proved that the
St. Aubins, father and son, had, from Julia’s
infancy, meditated, and ever since, step by step,
proceeded with the plot for carrying her away,
as soon as she should be of age. The spoils of
her very large fortune, (rendered, by the death
of Lady L⸺ and her infant son, unalienable,)
they were ultimately to have divided, while the
income of the Craigs would have been the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
reward of their diabolical labours. Their
victim, poor Julia, was to have been kept
abroad, in strict concealment—the wife, by
compulsion, of Henry, till cruel treatment and
horrible threats should compel her to declare
herself married to him by her own free choice.
He was to have corresponded, meanwhile, in
her name, with her family; having, it appeared,
for this purpose, actually practised, for
years, the imitation of her handwriting. It
was also found that he had possessed himself
of impressions of her seals, duplicates of her
keys, &amp;c. On the subject of his being the intercepter
of Fitz-Ullin’s proposals, and the
writer of Julia’s supposed rejection, there was
a letter of his, which exulted in the fact, and
related his good fortune in having himself
taken the precious epistle, as he termed it,
from the postman, and having been inspired to
suspect the truth on seeing it directed to Julia,
in our hero’s hand. There could be no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
that Henry was also the author of all the other
forged letters.</p>

<p>Parts of the correspondence contained expressions
and allusions which proved that the
elder St. Aubin was the person who, under
the name of Lauson, and assisted with keys
and vouchers provided by Henry, had stripped
the Craigs of all its valuables. By the produce
of these it appeared the necessary funds had
been raised for carrying on the desperate
design on Julia herself, shortly after attempted.
It further appeared that, by a curious
combination of circumstances, the St. Aubins
had, since a short time before the memorable
attempt on our hero’s life at the masquerade
at Arandale, been acquainted with the real
birth of Fitz-Ullin, then known as the poor
Edmund Montgomery.</p>

<p>The circumstances were as follows. Jin of
the Gins, (whose identity with the strolling
beggar, who stole Edmund when a child, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
not, we trust, forgotten,) had, it seems, been
so long in the employ of the elder St. Aubin
as a confidential agent for the concealment
and disposal of smuggled goods, and the conduct
of various other transactions of a like
nature, that she had, in her turn, confided
to him the secret of our hero’s birth, for the
purpose of consulting him as to whether the
said secret was, or was not marketable. She
had even offered to go shares with him, provided
he would assist her in making something
of the business. He had, of course, dissuaded
her from taking any step that might
risk discovery before the marriage of Julia to
Henry should be effected, after which he promised
to put her in the way of extorting a
sum, either from the nurse and her son for
keeping the secret, or from Lord Fitz-Ullin,
the father, then living, and Edmund his
rightful heir, for disclosing it. All this was
explained in a letter from the outlaw to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
son, as an argument for redoubled vigilance
in the watch the latter always kept over Julia
and Edmund. In the elder St. Aubin’s next
letter, his fears of the consequences of Julia’s attachment
to our hero seem to have been much
increased by some late accounts from Henry;
for he even hints at how desirable it would be
to rid themselves of all apprehension of danger
from that quarter, and concludes by commanding
his son to procure him a ticket to
the Arandale masquerade, where, by approaching
the parties in disguise, he should be enabled,
he says, to judge himself of the urgency
of the case. This epistle left no doubt that
the elder St. Aubin had acted the part of the
Indian juggler. Another letter contained allusions
identifying him with the false pilot,
who had attempted to run the Euphrasia aground
at Leith.</p>

<p>In an early part of the correspondence the
fate of poor Betsy Park was spoken of as having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
been untimely; but so darkly that whether
the dreadful apprehensions which cost poor
David his life, were well or ill founded must
remain for ever involved in mystery. One of
the letters of the elder St. Aubin, however,
was of a very suspicious tendency, as it expressed
the most unbridled rage towards Henry
for having committed any folly which might
ultimately interfere with the perfect legality of
his projected marriage with Julia; adding,
with savage ferocity, that whatever step his
own imprudence had made necessary must be
taken without flinching. Those letters may
appear, considering the subjects of which they
treat, to have been imprudently written: but
the precaution of the invisible ink seems by
the correspondents to have been thought all
sufficient. It must also be observed that the
information now obtained is collected from
scattered hints darkly enough given, but elucidated
on the present occasion by a comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
of both sides of the correspondence,
a contingency scarcely to have been anticipated.
That such letters, however, were not
all regularly destroyed is only one proof more,
added to the many already extant, of the glaring
imprudence with which vicious proceedings
of every description are almost invariably carried
on.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ expressed himself greatly shocked
at those proofs of Henry’s depravity. “We
certainly have before us,” rejoined Mr. Jackson,
“melancholy evidence that he has, from
a boy, lived the base tool of his desperate
father, the convenient link of the outlaw with
civilized society, the slave of a tyrant whom he
could not love, yet, from the spell of habit unbroken
from childhood, dared not resist. How
he at last died by the hand of that parent, we
have seen: and, that the blow by which he fell
may be invested with its full portion of horror,
we must remember that it was struck with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
the intent to murder, though not to murder
Henry.”</p>

<p>“To facilitate the retaking of his ship,”
said Fitz-Ullin, “by the death of the only
officer on board, was, I should think, all that
the elder St. Aubin could have had in view by
his wanton assassination, in cold blood, of a
person he believed to be a stranger.”</p>

<p>Henry’s having no knowledge to whom the
privateer belonged, when he went on board her
as prize-master, was accounted for by an attention
to dates, which showed that she had been entirely
fitted out and manned, since he, Henry,
had last gone to sea in the Euphrasia. Each
shocking discovery had been discussed, as the
letter or letters throwing light on each, had
been severally perused. The final decision of
the gentlemen was, that none of the circumstances
should ever be mentioned to Mrs.
Montgomery; and that even to Julia and
Frances, the disgusting scene of guilt and misery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
should be but partially, and gradually
laid open.</p>

<p>Lord L⸺ was the first to leave the library:
the retrospect of past years always spread a
shade over his brow, and occasioned him to
seek the retirement of his own apartment.
Fitz-Ullin was also hurrying away, when Mr.
Jackson drew him back, and, with a countenance
of the deepest melancholy, showed him
a letter which he had, he said, succeeded in
setting apart while examining the papers.</p>

<p>This letter contained allusions to the death
of Lady L⸺, worded in a style which made it
appear but too probable, that there has been
some foul play.</p>

<p>The vengeance which the elder St. Aubin had
long since sworn to accomplish, and, in its
accomplishment, to render his wretched child
his tool, is adverted to in evident connexion
with other allusions to the immense fortune
thus by the nature of certain settlements, secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
beyond contingency to a certain individual:
expressions which, all circumstances considered,
seemed scarcely to admit of other construction.</p>

<p>When Fitz-Ullin had finished the perusal of
the lines pointed out to him, both gentlemen
looked at each other for some seconds in silence.
Mr. Jackson then, taking the letter from the
hand of our hero, said solemnly, “With your
approval, my Lord, I shall commit this paper
to the flames: the surmise it suggests, is too
horrible to be suffered to poison the future reflections
of a bereft husband.</p>

<p>“If the crime which that surmise presents to
the appalled imagination, has indeed been perpetrated,
both the perpetrators already stand
before a higher, and more unerring tribunal,
than earth affords.” So saying, he flung the
letter on the fire, and stood to see its last vestiges
consumed.</p>

<div class="verse">“Precious is the return of that lost look</div>
<div class="verse">Of love.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fitz-Ullin</span>, at length released, sought our
heroine from room to room. That unreserved
communication of sentiment with her which
had been looked forward to with such intoxicating
delight, was now anticipated with a
sobered feeling: it was now longed for as a
balm to heal a sickened, and if, in his circumstances,
that were possible, an almost saddened
spirit.</p>

<p>Julia was not to be found in the house; he
therefore wandered into the shrubbery, where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
at the very paling gate at which they had
parted on such miserable terms the evening
before, he perceived her, and Frances with her.
The latter, however, with a sportive air, disappeared
at sight of our hero, who, the next
moment, stood before Julia. Scarcely had one
smile beamed on him, ere all that had almost
forced the blissful explanation of the morning
from its first place in his mind, was forgotten.
This same smile, to Fitz-Ullin, who for so
long had not had even a smile, seemed all
sufficient; for the lovers now walked on in
silence. By the time, however, that they had
completed the round of the wood-walk, as it is
called, and re-entered the shrubbery at the further
end, they appeared not only to have recovered
the use of speech, but to have become
quite confidential, for they now held between
them an open letter, which they seemed to be
reading together. From an observation which
our hero made as they finished the perusal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
the letter, it was probably the one which he
had in the morning promised to show Julia,
and which had cost both so much misery.</p>

<p>“That letter,” he said, “I cannot view
without shuddering. It has so long governed
my fate, that I shall never learn to consider it
what it really is, a mere unimportant scrap of
paper, blotted and rendered foul by falsehood!”
Every hour of their past lives was now reviewed;
every word, every look, adverted to; and
one little spellword found, which, now that it
might be spoken, reconciled every contradiction,
and solved every mystery. The light, in
short, of <em>First Love</em>, that brightest sunshine
of the heart, was now flung back on the long
perspective of years gone by, shedding its
beams on the distant scene, and displaying,
decked in their natural and pleasing colours,
all those greenest spots on memory’s waste,
which hopelessness had hitherto overshadowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
or treachery presented through its own false
medium.</p>

<p>Such recapitulations, however, to all but the
parties interested, might seem tedious; we
shall not therefore go through all; yet, were
they most natural in those, whose every feeling
had been for so long put to the torture, by the
cruelest misrepresentations of all that most
concerned their happiness. It was no wonder
that they were not satisfied by merely telling
their understandings, with a sweeping clause,
that all was just the contrary of what it had
been, or rather of what it had appeared to be;
they felt that they owed to themselves, as it
were, the delight of reversing each individual
picture, and that hearts so long inured to
suffering, required to be soothed into a confidence
in their own felicity, by dwelling for a
time on its details.</p>

<p>The scene in the refreshment room was adverted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
to. “When you kindly spoke,” he
said, “of the consolation I ought to derive
from friendship, and of my disappointed hopes
never having been well founded, how bitter
were my feelings! I understood you to mean,
coolly to inform me that, if I had ever entertained
a hope of being acceptable to you, it
was false and presumptuous! I almost felt
resentment; for, shall I say it, Julia, I
thought,” and he hesitated, “that you had
not always treated me as—as honour and good
feeling should have dictated to a woman, whose
affections were engaged to another.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Julia, colouring, “could not
help thinking you very unkind and unfeeling,
indeed, in rejecting, in the scornful and almost
angry manner you did, my—all our friendship,
and saying that the hope of being accepted by
Lady Susan, (as I supposed,) was all that, in
your eyes, had given value to existence!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Julia,” he said, “the hope I spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of was, indeed, all that in my eyes gave value
to existence!”</p>

<p>When they had thus discussed points of tenderer
interest, and at length seated themselves
in an arbour particularly well calculated for
the reception of lovers, Edmund, after a short
silence, said, rather suddenly, “What must
you have thought, Julia, of my interference
about Lord Surrel?”</p>

<p>“I was very much obliged,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Why, nothing could have justified me,”
he continued, “but the belief, not only of your
attachment, but of your engagement, and of
my being the sole person to whom that engagement
had been confided. Why, what could
you have supposed when I requested a private
interview, and commenced questioning you on
such a subject?”</p>

<p>Julia did not reply; but she blushed, and
looked away in so hurried a manner, that a
sudden thought darted across the mind of Fitz-Ullin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
He caught her hand, and looking in
her face with the most curiously amused expression
of countenance, said, “No, Julia,
did you give my request the common interpretation?”</p>

<p>No reply from Julia; but the twisting away,
or rather the trying to twist away of the hand,
the deepening of the blush, the averting of the
eyes, were confirmations all sufficient. Our
hero could not help still smiling, while he tried
to reconcile and to sooth. This, of course,
offended more than it appeased, and the hand,
though it had been kissed a thousand times,
still manifested signs of being an unwilling
captive. Fitz-Ullin was now obliged to apologize,
so that all rational conversation was put
an end to. Nay, he even knelt, and succeeded
in making the other hand a prisoner; but notwithstanding
all this humility of attitude, the
countenance had, mixed with its absolute delight,
a sort of triumph in the very fulness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
his felicity, with which Julia could not yet
bring herself to be quite as well pleased, as
with that expression which she had often remarked
on former occasions, when, by giving
Edmund the hundredth part of a smile, she had
made him look humbly happy. After a short
pause, however, employed in making his peace
as well as he might, he renewed the conversation
by saying, “And what could you have
thought, Julia, of my reiterated declarations,
that mine were but the claims of a brother?”
This was another of the subjects on which she
could not reply, and he went on. “I believed
you justly shocked at the idea that you were
about to be addressed as a lover, by one who
knew your melancholy secret; and that, too,
so soon after the terrible death of poor Henry.
I hastened to do away such a suspicion; for,
if I had a selfish hope, it was a distant one of
course, and one which I did not, at the time,
distinctly confess, even to myself. Under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
same false impressions I viewed, with utter
amazement, the composure of countenance,
voice, and manner, which you maintained,
when things were said by others which I heard
with terror, from the supposition that the very
sounds must be shocking to your ears. When,
for instance, Mr. Jackson read aloud the account
of the trial, which, necessarily included the circumstances
of the murder. The day of the funeral
too; in short, I was thrown out of every calculation.
I had expected to endure much from
seeing you shed tears for one who, even in
death, I could have envied any testimony of
your affection; I had armed myself for this
trial, severe as it must have proved, but I was
altogether unprepared to find the being I had
loved for the tenderness of her nature, the
innocence of her heart, totally without feeling,
or a consummate actress, or worse, a creature
capable of having formed, from mere levity,
without even the excuse of a sincere though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
misplaced attachment, an engagement, unsanctioned
by a father, and imprudent in itself.</p>

<p>“That I should ever be able to win the love of
one whose very friendship I had lost by declaring
my attachment, one whom I now appeared
to inspire with dread, was a thing quite hopeless.
I saw, indeed, what were Lord L⸺’s
flattering wishes. The very idea seemed to
shake the powers of my mind, to darken my
judgment, madden my passions, and harden my
heart; for there were moments of bitterness,
in which I asked myself, should I set your feelings
at defiance, and avail myself of Lord
L⸺’s authority to obtain you! The thought
was of course rejected with disdain; but, its
ever having crossed my imagination, was sufficient
to prove, that I was no longer master of
myself.”</p>

<p>“I wish, Edmund,” said Julia, when in the
evening the lovers again directed their steps
towards the shrubbery walk, “you would tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
me what it was that caused your peculiar
austerity of manner on board the Euphrasia.”</p>

<p>“Why, that is a question which I cannot
very well answer, Julia,” said Fitz-Ullin, smiling
and taking her hand. She persisted, however.
“You must remember,” he said at
length, “that I believed you perfectly acquainted
with my sentiments. In the innocent
friendship of your manner, therefore, I saw—what
appeared to me, seeing through a false
medium, the weakness, if I must say it, of a
woman who could not altogether resign the
admiration of, even a rejected lover. And, in
a woman who was herself engaged, it seemed
doubly cruel, to foster with smiles (that, to one
who already loved, and believed his love known
to her who smiled, must bewilder every sense;
and that for the mere idle gratification of
vanity,) an unfortunate passion which she could
not return, which, in fact, she had already cast
from her!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>“My own Julia!” he exclaimed, suddenly
stopping short and taking both her hands,
“you really look as much condemned as if I
had brought this horrible accusation against
your pure innocent self in due form; but,” he
added, “you must consider that when we are
very miserable, we are never very just to those
who cause our suffering! Weak too as I
thought your conduct, its effects were too much
for my strength of mind: I felt that it was
dangerous to be near you. In how different
a light would all that imagination thus misconstrued
have appeared, could I have suspected
that it was generous pity for my supposed
disappointment about Lady Susan which gave
that dangerous softness to your manner, unchecked
by any idea that my feelings towards
yourself had ever been other than those of an
adopted brother. And now, Julia, it is your
turn to make confessions: do tell me what
crowning of all my presumption was it, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
which you suspected me when, no later than
last evening, your gentle nature was, at length,
provoked to say, ‘What can you mean? What
can you dare to mean?’” She appeared very
unwilling to reply; he entreated her to tell
him, at least, to what feelings of hers it was
she thought he meant to allude. At length
she stammered out, “I suppose—I thought—I—must
have thought—you meant—my—my—regard
for—for yourself.”</p>

<p>A delighted smile grew gradually over the
features of Fitz-Ullin as he bent his head, trying
to follow the downcast eyes, and catch the
broken accents of the speaker. “But how
then,” he whispered, “did you account for
my not gladly, delightedly availing myself of—of—your—amiable
condescension?”</p>

<p>What words Julia found, or whether she
found any, in her opinion, sufficiently delicate
by which to express that she had understood
him to have apologized more than once for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
not being able to return the secret affection
he had discovered her to entertain for him,
we cannot exactly say, for here the scene
closes. No very serious misunderstanding,
however, appears to have ensued, for the lovers
returned to tea with perfectly happy faces,
and, during that cheerful ceremony, Edmund’s
delight assumed almost an extravagant cast,
while Julia actually began to prefer his looking
quite happy to that more humble expression
of dependance on her sovereign will and
pleasure for the slightest portion of his felicity,
which used to gratify her so much.</p>

<p>The beginnings of love may be selfish, may
be tyrannical, may require that vanity and thirst
of power shall have due tribute paid them;
but, when love is perfected, not only is vanity
cast away, power and pride laid down, but
self, that idol of the unoccupied heart, is forgotten,
or valued only as contributing to the
happiness of the being beloved! We speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
of course, of that early sunbeam of life’s morning,
<em>First Love</em>: the description here given
can never be applicable to the mixed nature of
the later awakened sentiment, with its thousand
necessary alloys: the selfishness called
into play by self-defence, the doubts of the
future, taught by experience of the past; with
all the calculating insinuations of interest hinting
the wisdom of training the heart’s tendrils
to cling to convenience.</p>

<p>Let the plant be love, of course, says prudence;
but why not place it in the comfortable
south aspect of wealth and splendour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> answer to all Fitz-Ullin’s arguments and
entreaties for an early day, Julia pleaded a due
respect to her grandmother’s feelings. In compliment
to these it was decided that the wedding
should not take place for three months.
But months flew past with the velocity of days,
all nature glowed with tints never seen before;
every bird sang a sweeter song than formerly;
particularly a thrush which had its nest in a
Portugal laurel, just behind the shady seat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
which the lovers strolled every evening. The
very climate was improved: it was never either
too hot or too cold, that is, in the opinion of
Julia and Fitz-Ullin. The rest of the world,
we believe, found the changes of weather much
such as they generally are in this, by all but
lovers, sadly abused climate of ours.</p>

<p>Previous to the expiration of the allotted
three months, the Arandale family arrived at
Lodore, together with the Marquis and Marchioness
of H⸺, Lord and Lady Morven,
shortly after, the Dowager Countess Fitz-Ullin,
and lastly, Colonel Beaumont, now the accepted
lover of Frances.</p>

<p>The weddings of both the sisters were solemnized
on the same day by Mr. Jackson, in
the same church in which he had baptized both,
and pronounced over the then unknown Edmund,
that memorable benediction, with which
he bestowed on him the temporary appellation
of Montgomery; a name under which, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
Mr. Jackson this day observed, our hero afterwards
reaped so many laurels, that to have
laid it aside for any title but that of Fitz-Ullin,
would have been rather a resignation of glory,
than an acquisition of splendour.</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Fitz-Ullin set out immediately
for the Craigs, whither they were
followed shortly by a large party of their
friends. Even Mrs. Montgomery, (who had
resolved never again to leave Lodore House,)
sustained by the renovating influence of happiness,
performed the journey, and did not
suffer from the exertion.</p>

<p>The Jews who had possession of the Oswald
estates, were obliged to resign them on the
production of the title-deeds. Now, therefore,
that every one but Gotterimo himself had
reaped the benefits of his honesty, it was high
time to think of rewarding him. Mrs. Smyth,
by the liberality of her mistress and the savings
of her long servitude, was enabled to give Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
a few hundreds. Lady Fitz-Ullin added a few
more for her jewel-box, not forgetting the
parcel of old letters by which it was accompanied.
Lord Fitz-Ullin gave a suitable acknowledgement
for the title-deeds of his wife’s
estate, the Craigs, not forgetting the long lost
happiness found in the bottom of the same old
chest. And Lady Oswald, most willingly,
paid a handsome reward for the discovery of
the title-deeds of her son’s estates. Thus portioned,
Alice was bestowed on our worthy little
friend, who carried her forthwith to London.
We are happy to add, that, from the credit
which his upright mode of dealing gained him,
his establishment became, in the course of time,
one of the greatest in that great city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the visit we have already mentioned to
the Craigs, a season in Town, and a quiet
month or two at dear Lodore, Fitz-Ullin prevailed
on Julia to accompany him to that gem
of the ocean, the Emerald Isle, the land of his
birth, for the purpose of visiting his extensive
paternal estates in the beautiful county of ⸺.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, nature indeed had been bountiful; but
her benign intentions had, hitherto, been defeated
by an ill judged organization of the
social system.</p>

<p>For six and twenty years, agents and middlemen
had oppressed the hardy tenant of the
soil; till, what had been courage, became
fierceness; what had been humour, bitterness;
and even native beauty of feature was veiled by
the utterly hopeless expression, which hung on
almost every countenance; while not the
muscles of the face only, but the very limbs of
naturally athletic men appeared relaxed. For
the rewards of labour being insufficient to
inspire industry, bodily fatigue was unsustained
by mental energy, and the mere animal instinct
of hunger remained the sole stimulus to exertion.</p>

<p>It had never entered the minds of this simple,
almost wild people, to look to the government
for justice or redress. The executive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
power, in all its branches, was, and long had
been, concentrated and personified in their
imaginations under the loathed figure of a
hangman; and him whom they considered as
their natural protector, their landlord, leader,
and hereditary chief, was out of the reach of
hearing their complaints. It is not surprising,
therefore, that the arrival of the happy couple,
surrounded by all the splendour to which their
rank and fortune entitled them, lending a ready
ear to every tale of woe, and with the hand of
benevolence open for the relief of every want,
was viewed by all as the rising of the morning
of hope, on a land long desolated by a dreary
succession of stormy nights that knew no day
between.</p>

<p>Fitz-Ullin was so forcibly struck by the
marks which all around him bore, of private
duties sacrificed to public ones, during the
long and brilliant life of the late Earl, that his
reflections and resolutions on the subject very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
shortly became such as we may trace in a conversation
which took place, a few evenings after
his arrival at Ullin Castle. He was seated with
his lovely Countess on the balcony of a high
tower, from whence might be seen on every
side, a large portion of the wide domains of
his forefathers.</p>

<p>He had been indulging in the fond hope,
justified by the then situation of Julia, that the
future possessor of all he now beheld, would,
ere long, enter life amid prospects delightful
to the heart of a parent, and sheltered too, he
trusted, under providence, from the rough
blasts, which he had in infancy encountered;
for Julia had promised him that she herself
would nurture her own child, and never commit
it to the hands of a stranger, to run the risk of
enduring what its father had endured.</p>

<p>While these gentle thoughts dwelt in his
mind, his eye accidentally rested on the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
that stole from the lowly chimneys of some
cottages, which, scattered at various intervals,
lay concealed among the distant trees.</p>

<p>As busy fancy painted the rustic group
around each fire-side, a something like self-reproach
smote upon the heart of Fitz-Ullin.</p>

<p>“How often,” he exclaimed, giving audible
utterance to his thoughts, “how often have I
felt enthusiasm, amounting almost to a wild
species of joy, when engaged in the work of
war, and, of course, of destruction; and behold
around me here, the labours of peace, the
power of diffusing happiness to multitudes,
lying neglected and forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Do not say the work of destruction!” interrupted
Julia, eagerly: “it never was in
your nature, Edmund, to take pleasure in destroying
the very worst of enemies! Say rather
the work, the glorious, the indispensable work
of protection; for of what avail would it be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
spread prosperity over the face of the land if
we suffer the foe to come in and lay our labours
waste?”</p>

<p>“True, Julia! most true!” replied Fitz-Ullin,
delighted to have his favourite and habitual
views of the subject thus revived. And
as he spoke, he arose unconsciously, and,
assuming a loftiness of carriage of which his
figure was peculiarly susceptible, looked once
more the hero—a character lately almost forgotten
in that of the lover.</p>

<p>“Seen in this light,” he said, “our duty
to our country is also one of the most sacred
of those which we owe to our kindred and
dependants, taken too on its greatest, its noblest
scale! The reflections, however, which
the scene before us has awakened, have had
their use; they have reminded me that, in the
pride of performing a selected task, gratifying
to our ambition or our vanity, we must not
neglect the manifold and unpretending duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
which surround our homes. You will allow,”
he added, changing his manner from the grave
to the sportive, “heroine as you are, Julia,
that in the intervals of peace, at least, we
ought to thatch the peasant’s hut, and see
that he has grain to sow his fields—aye,” he
continued, his voice and manner again becoming
serious, “and a cheerful countenance
when he reaps them, emanating from the consciousness
that a liberal portion of all which
the labour of his hands has caused the ground
to bring forth shall be his own and his children’s.
Nor is this more than just: large
estates were small, indeed, in value to their
luxurious possessor, did not the sweat of the
brow of his fellow-creature render them productive.”</p>

<p>The impressions received by the mind of
Fitz-Ullin on this evening were never effaced.
In the course of promotion he became, as his
father had been, Admiral Lord Fitz-Ullin, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
under that title, continued to reap, when called
upon by the emergencies of the state, laurels
as distinguished as any gained by his great
predecessor; but his people at home were
never forgotten. His sons and his daughters
were born amongst them, and all the many
silent blessings which fall from the hand of
the resident landlord introduced into their
dwellings. While as much of a long, blissful,
and prosperous life as he could spare from his
more active duties to his country, and his
closer ties to his immediate family and dependants
was devoted to the noble task of
pleading the cause of the oppressed of his
native land in the great assembly of his peers.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
